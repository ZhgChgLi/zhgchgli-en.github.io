### Apple Watch Original Stainless Steel Milanese Loop Unboxing

Apple Original Stainless Steel 44mm Graphite Milanese Loop Unboxing

Following the previous post "[Apple Watch Series 6 Unboxing & Two Years Usage Review](../eab0e984043/)", I finally decided to get the [original Milanese loop](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/product/MTU22FE/A/40-%E5%85%AC%E9%87%90%E9%8A%80%E8%89%B2%E7%B1%B3%E8%98%AD%E5%BC%8F%E9%8C%B6%E7%92%B0){:target="_blank"}. I had wanted to buy it two years ago but never did; this time, I decided to update everything at once. Apple guarantees that the bands are compatible with all subsequent Apple Watch versions, so there's no worry about the band not fitting future updates.

#### Advantages

The Milanese loop is made of stainless steel mesh and a magnetic clasp. The benefits of the stainless steel mesh are breathability and quick drying; the magnetic clasp allows the band to be adjusted to any position, fits the wrist better, is easy to wear, and has strong magnetism, so it won't fall off. Most importantly, it makes the Apple Watch look more formal and easier to match with outfits.

#### Disadvantages

It pulls hair, pulls hair, pulls hair, and is relatively heavy.

#### Original vs. Third-party?

Having been in Apple communities for a while, I've noticed that the most frequently asked question is about the original vs. third-party Milanese loop. Personally, I think the difference is not significant, mainly in the details and craftsmanship. The original also pulls hair, but the original's weaving is very delicate and integrated, the magnetic part is very strong and won't loosen, and it's clean and skin-friendly without a rusty smell. However, the price difference is several times (the original costs $3,100). It's best to touch the actual product before deciding. I guess third-party Milanese loops costing 1-2 thousand should almost equal the original in craftsmanship.

#### Size

As mentioned in the [previous post](../eab0e984043/), it's recommended for those with smaller wrists to buy the Apple Watch 40mm, as the 40mm Milanese loop fits wrists 130–180mm, compared to the 44mm Milanese loop, which fits wrists 150–200mm, 20mm shorter.

The band is one-piece and cannot be adjusted in length; if the band is already tight but still too big, you can only consider third-party options, or gain some weight (?). So it's safer to try it on in-store.

Similar to the original silicone band, but the difference is that it doesn't come with an extra short band XD
