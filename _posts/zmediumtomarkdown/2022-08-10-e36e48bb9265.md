#### App Reviews Workflow Integration Example (in Pinkoi)

**Problem:**

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*ZULed1sGV4YzAAezw_fCaQ.png)

Reviews in the marketplace are very important for products, but it is a very manual and repetitive task to communicate and refer.

Because you have to manually check for new reviews from time to time, and if there are customer service issues, forward them to customer service for assistance. It's repetitive and manual.

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*Ptph8qaLqoTaNw9Fp7VTqw.png)

Through the ZReviewTender review bot, reviews are automatically forwarded to the Slack Channel, allowing everyone to quickly receive the latest review information, and track and discuss in real-time. It also allows the entire team to understand the current user reviews and suggestions for the product.

For more information, refer to: [2021 Pinkoi Tech Career Talk — High-Efficiency Engineering Team Demystified](../11f6c8568154/).
### Deployment — Using Default Features Only

If you only need the default features of ZReviewTender (to Slack/Google Translate/Filter), you can use the following quick deployment method.

ZReviewTender has been packaged and released on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}, and you can quickly and easily install and use ZReviewTender with RubyGems.
#### [Recommended] Deploy Directly Using Github Repo Template
- No hosting space required ✅
- No environment requirements ✅
- No need to understand engineering principles ✅
- Complete the Config file configuration to complete the deployment ✅
- Deployment can be completed in 8 steps ✅
- Completely free ✅
Github Action provides each account with 2,000+ minutes/month of execution time. Running ZReviewTender review fetching once only takes about 15-30 seconds.
By default, it runs every 6 hours, 4 times a day, **consuming only about 60 minutes per month**.
Github Private Repo can be created without any limit for free.

1. Go to the ZReviewTender Template Repo: [**ZReviewTender-deploy-with-github-action**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender-deploy-with-github-action){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*1pn3bxyBO0FoY4oIRvKCNg.png)

Click the "Use this template" button at the top right.

2. Create Repo

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*YCBJJlSN4ZYjKMz7WBVIAQ.png)

- Repository name: Enter the name of the Repo project you want
- Access: **Private**

> ⚠️⚠️ Be sure to create a **Private Repo** ⚠️⚠️

> **Because you will upload settings and private keys to the project**

Finally, click the "Create repository from template" button at the bottom.

3. Confirm that your created Repo is a Private Repo

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*1ZHF9CIOMV8S12Xw2P4B8g.png)

Confirm that the Repo name at the top right shows "🔒" and the Private label.

If not, it means you created a **Public Repo which is very dangerous**, please go to the top Tab "Settings" -> "General" -> Bottom "Danger Zone" -> "Change repository visibility" -> "Make private" **to change it back to Private Repo**.

4. Wait for Project init to succeed

You can check the Badge in the Readme on the Repo homepage

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*aN9IkRx2BnAKFk8VW9ORVw.png)

If it shows passing, it means init was successful.

Or click the top Tab "Actions" -> wait for the "Init ZReviewTender" Workflow to complete:

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*jThU3BbKvOT6nl51yklqtg.png)

Here you can see an error because I haven't configured my config yml file properly.

Go back and adjust the android/apple config yml, then return to step 6 and trigger the execution again.

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*SAiaDofDwiFI8Z3ndDGz2w.png)

Check the log of the " `ZReviewTender -r` " block to confirm successful execution!

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*W5PHoBzHQxV1WQ82TrZqfA.png)

The Slack channel designated to receive the latest review messages will also show an init success message 🎉

8. **Done!** 🎉 🎉 🎉

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*8WcmenKeWSd92DjWeAQSGg.png)

Configuration complete! From now on, the latest reviews within the period will be automatically fetched and forwarded to your Slack channel every 6 hours!

You can check the latest execution status at the top of the Readme on the Repo homepage:

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*sz4piAAAhOqEGP0EFbMmKg.png)

If an error occurs, it means there was an execution error. Please go to Actions -> ZReviewTender to view the records; if there is an unexpected error, please [**create an Issue**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/issues){:target="_blank"} **with the record information, and it will be fixed as soon as possible!**

> ❌❌❌ When an error occurs, Github will also send an email notification, so you don't have to worry about the bot crashing without anyone noticing!

#### Github Action Adjustment

You can configure the Github Action execution rules according to your needs.

Click on the "Actions" tab above -> "ZReviewTender" on the left -> " `ZReviewTender.yml` " on the top right

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*DnquiwKTgYY6R2ysNx8F1w.png)

Click the "✏️" on the top right to edit the file.

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*HY_f3zOivHGQv5tuwUyw8Q.png)

**There are two parameters that can be adjusted:**

**cron**: Set how often to check for new reviews. The default is `15 */6 * * *`, which means it will run every 6 hours and 15 minutes.

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*cUGMHPmjlMRV_rRXItN4qg.png)

You can refer to [crontab\.guru](https://crontab.guru/#15_*/6_*_*_*){:target="_blank"} to configure it according to your needs.

> **Please note:**

> 1. Github Action uses the UTC time zone

> 2. The higher the execution frequency, the more Github Action execution quota will be consumed

**run**: Set the command to be executed. You can refer to the " **Execution** " section below. The default is `ZReviewTender -r`
- Default execution for Android App & Apple (iOS/macOS App): `ZReviewTender -r`

#### Manually Trigger ZReviewTender

Refer to the previous section "6. Initialize ZReviewTender (Manually trigger execution once)"
#### Install Using Gem

If you are familiar with Gems, you can directly use the following command to install `ZReviewTender`
```bash
gem install ZReviewTender
```
#### Install Using Gem (Not familiar with Ruby/Gems)

If you are not familiar with Ruby or Gems, you can follow the steps below to install `ZReviewTender` step by step
1. Although macOS comes with Ruby, it is recommended to use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"} or [rvm](https://rvm.io/){:target="_blank"} to install a new Ruby and manage Ruby versions (I use `2.6.5`)
2. Use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"} or [rvm](https://rvm.io/){:target="_blank"} to install Ruby 2.6.5, and switch to rbenv/rvm's Ruby
3. Use `which ruby` to confirm that the current Ruby in use is **not** the system Ruby `/usr/bin/ruby`
4. Once the Ruby environment is OK, use the following command to install `ZReviewTender`

```typescript
gem install ZReviewTender
```
### Deployment — Want to Extend Functionality Yourself
#### Manual
1. git clone [**ZReviewTender**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} Source Code
2. Confirm & improve the Ruby environment
3. Enter the directory and run `bundle install` to install related dependencies for [**ZReviewTender**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}

The method for creating a Processor can be referred to in the later content of the article.
### Configuration

[**ZReviewTender**](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"} — Use a yaml file to configure the Apple/Google review bot.

**[Recommendation]** Directly use the command at the bottom of the article — "Generate Configuration File":
```bash
ZReviewTender -i
```

Directly generate blank `apple.yml` & `android.yml` configuration files.
#### Apple (iOS/macOS App)

Refer to the apple.example.yml file:

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/516425682/1cc1a829-d87d-4d4a-925b-60471b912b23)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/config/apple.example.yml){:target="_blank"}

> ⚠️ After downloading `apple.example.yml`, remember to rename the file to `apple.yml`

apple.yml:
```yaml

#### GCP Service Account

The Google API services used by ZReviewTender (fetching store reviews, Google Translate, Google Sheet) all use Service Account authentication.

You can follow the [**official steps to create GCP & Service Account**](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#create_service_account){:target="_blank"} to download and save the GCP Service Account credentials (`*.json`).
- To use the auto-translate feature, make sure GCP has enabled `Cloud Translation API` and the Service Account is added.
- To use the record to Google Sheet feature, make sure GCP has enabled `Google Sheets API`, `Google Drive API`, and the Service Account is added.

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*VaVD2bdnbVwWCAuwhV90sA.png)

#### Google Play Console (Android App)

Refer to the android.example.yml file:

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/516425682/1cc1a829-d87d-4d4a-925b-60471b912b23)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/config/android.example.yml){:target="_blank"}

> ⚠️ After downloading `android.example.yml`, remember to rename the file to `android.yml`

android.yml:
```yaml
platform: 'android'
packageName: '' # Android App Package Name
keyFilePath: '' # Google Android Publisher API Credential .json File Path
playConsoleDeveloperAccountID: '' # Google Console Developer Account ID
playConsoleAppID: '' # Google Console App ID
......
```

**packageName:**

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*XRzKNGhVbBef7Hl9XPcaWw.png)

packageName: `com.XXXXX` can be obtained from [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/){:target="_blank"} -> Dashboard -> App

**playConsoleDeveloperAccountID & playConsoleAppID:**

Can be obtained from the URL on the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/){:target="_blank"} -> Dashboard -> App page:

[https://play.google.com/console/developers/ **playConsoleDeveloperAccountID** /app/ **playConsoleAppID** /app-dashboard](https://play.google.com/console/developers/playConsoleDeveloperAccountID/app/playConsoleAppID/app-dashboard){:target="_blank"}

This will be used to generate a review message link, allowing the team to quickly access the backend review reply page by clicking the link.

**keyFilePath:**

The most important information, GCP Service Account credential key (`*.json`)

Follow the steps in the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started){:target="_blank"} to create a Google Cloud Project & Service Account, then go to Google Play Console -> Setup -> API Access to enable the `Google Play Android Developer API` and link the project.

    ...More Processors...
```

ZReviewTender comes with four processors, and the order affects the data processing flow: FilterProcessor -> GoogleTranslateProcessor -> SlackProcessor -> GoogleSheetProcessor.

**FilterProcessor:**

Filters the fetched reviews based on specified conditions, only processing reviews that meet the criteria.
- class: `FilterProcessor` No need to adjust, points to lib/Processors/ `FilterProcessor` .rb
- enable: `true` / `false` Enable this processor or not
- keywordsInclude: \[“ `keyword1` ”,“ `keyword2` ”…\] Filters reviews that contain these keywords
- ratingsInclude: \[ `1` , `2` …\] 1~5 Filters reviews that include these ratings
- territoriesInclude: \[“ `zh-hant` ”,” `TWN` ”…\] Filters reviews that include these regions (Apple) or languages (Android)

**GoogleTranslateProcessor:**

Translate the reviews into the specified language.
- class: `GoogleTranslateProcessor` No adjustment needed, points to lib/Processors/ `GoogleTranslateProcessor` \.rb
- enable: `true` / `false` Enable this Processor or Not
- googleTranslateAPIKeyFilePath: `/gcp_key.json` GCP Service Account credential key File Path `*.json`, place the file in the same directory as the config yml, refer to the Google Play Console JSON key example above.
\(Please ensure that the service account of the JSON key has `Cloud Translation API` permissions\)
- googleTranslateTargetLang: `zh-TW`, `en` …target translation language
- googleTranslateTerritoriesExclude: \[“ `zh-hant` ”,” `TWN` ”…\] Territories (Apple) or languages (Android) that do not need translation

**SlackProcessor:**

- enable: `true` / `false` Enable this Processor or Not
- slackTimeZoneOffset: `+08:00` Review time display time zone
- slackAttachmentGroupByNumber: `1` Set how many Reviews to combine into one message to speed up sending; default is 1 Review per 1 Slack message.
- slackBotToken: `xoxb-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` [Slack Bot Token](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace){:target="_blank"}, Slack recommends creating a Slack Bot with `postMessages` Scope and using it to send Slack messages
- slackBotTargetChannel: `CXXXXXX` Group ID \( **not the group name** \), the Slack Bot will send to which Channel group; and **you need to add your Slack Bot to that group**
- slackInCommingWebHookURL: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXX` Use the old [InComming WebHookURL](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks){:target="_blank"} to send messages to Slack, note! Slack does not recommend continuing to use this method to send messages.

> Please note, this is a legacy custom integration — an outdated way for teams to integrate with Slack. These integrations lack newer features and they will be deprecated and possibly removed in the future. **We do not recommend their use.** Instead, we suggest that you check out their replacement: [Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/start){:target="_blank"}.

- slackBotToken and slackInCommingWebHookURL, SlackProcessor will preferentially choose to use slackBotToken

#### Custom Processor to Integrate Your Workflow

If you need a custom Processor, please use manual deployment, as the gem version of ZReviewTender is packaged and cannot be dynamically adjusted.

You can refer to [lib/Processors/ProcessorTemplate\.rb](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/lib/Processors/ProcessorTemplate.rb){:target="_blank"} to create your extension:
```ruby
$lib = File.expand_path('../lib', File.dirname(__FILE__))

require "Models/Review"
require "Models/Processor"
require "Helper"
require "ZLogger"

# Add to config.yml:
#
# processors:
#   - ProcessorTemplate:
#       class: "ProcessorTemplate"
#       parameter1: "value"
#       parameter2: "value"
#       parameter3: "value"
#       ...
#

class ProcessorTemplate < Processor

    def initialize(config, configFilePath, baseExecutePath)
        # init Processor
        # get parameter from config e.g. config["parameter1"]
        # configFilePath: file path of config file (apple.yml/android.yml)
        # baseExecutePath: user execute path
    end

    def processReviews(reviews, platform)
        if reviews.length < 1

        ## do what you want to do with reviews...
        
        ## return result reviews
        return reviews
    end
end
```

**initialize will provide:**
- config Object: Corresponding settings in the config yml
- configFilePath: Path of the used config yml file
- baseExecutePath: Path where the user executes ZReviewTender


**processReviews(reviews, platform):**

After fetching new reviews, this function will be called to allow the Processor to handle them. Please return the resulting Reviews after processing.

Review data structure is defined in lib/Models/ [Review\.rb](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender/blob/main/lib/Models/Review.rb){:target="_blank"}
#### Notes

`XXXterritorXXX` **parameter:**
- Apple Region: TWM/JPN…
- Android Language: zh-hant/en/…


**If a Processor is not needed:** 
You can set `enable: false` or directly remove the Processor Config Block.
```

**Processors execution order can be adjusted according to your needs:**
e.g. Execute Filter first, then Translation, then Slack, then Log to Google Sheet...
### Execution

> ⚠️ Use Gem to directly run `ZReviewTender`, if it's a manual deployment project, please use `bundle exec ruby bin/ZReviewTender` to execute.

#### Generate configuration files:
```css
ZReviewTender -i
```

Generate apple.yml & android.yml from apple.example.yml & android.example.yml to the `config/` directory in the current execution directory.
#### Execute Apple & Android review scraping:
```bash
ZReviewTender -r
```
- By default, read the `apple.yml` & `android.yml` settings under `/config/`

#### Execute Apple & Android review scraping & specify configuration file directory:
```bash
ZReviewTender --run=configuration file directory
```
- By default, read the `apple.yml` & `android.yml` settings under `/config/`

#### Execute only Apple review scraping:
```bash
ZReviewTender -a
```
- By default, read the `apple.yml` settings under `/config/`

#### Execute only Apple review scraping & specify configuration file location:
```bash
ZReviewTender --apple=apple.yml configuration file location
```
#### Execute only Android review scraping:
```bash
ZReviewTender -g
```
- By default, read the `android.yml` settings under `/config/`

#### Execute only Android review scraping & specify configuration file location:
```bash
ZReviewTender --googleAndroid=android.yml configuration file location
```
#### Clear execution records and return to initial settings
```bash
ZReviewTender -d
```

This will delete the Timestamp record file in `/latestCheckTimestamp`, returning to the initial state. Re-executing the scraping will receive the init success message again:

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*8qVrSt1pXwNncPG_GEgm9A.png)

#### Current ZReviewTender version
```bash
ZReviewTender -v
```

Displays the latest version number of ZReviewTender on [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/ZReviewTender){:target="_blank"}.
#### Update ZReviewTender to the latest version (rubygem only)
```bash
ZReviewTender -n
```
#### First execution

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*62VO8mbJWxXHSeFo3fEUog.png)

The first successful execution will send an initialization success message to the specified Slack Channel and generate `latestCheckTimestamp/Apple` and `latestCheckTimestamp/Android` files in the corresponding execution directory to record the last scraped review Timestamp.

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*U8vjWSHvY2RzUBcUbQoBvQ.png)

Additionally, an `execute.log` will be generated to record execution errors.

![](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*TR8IMke6FC1ZktFOiXUWLw.png)

#### Set up a schedule for continuous execution

Set up a schedule (using [crontab](https://crontab.guru/){:target="_blank"}) to continuously scrape new reviews. ZReviewTender will scrape new reviews from the last scraped review Timestamp recorded in `latestCheckTimestamp` to the current scraping time and update the Timestamp record file.

e.g. crontab: `15 */6 * * * ZReviewTender -r`

Additionally, note that since the Android API only provides reviews added or edited in the last 7 days, the schedule cycle should not exceed 7 days to avoid missing reviews.

=========================
#### The War with App Reviews

I thought last year's summary of [**AppStore APP’s Reviews Slack Bot**](../cb0c68c33994/) and the related technology implementation of [**ZReviewsBot — Slack App Review Notification Bot**](../33f6aabb744f/) would conclude the integration of the latest App reviews into the company's workflow; unexpectedly, Apple [updated the App Store Connect API](../f1365e51902c/) this year, allowing this matter to continue evolving.

Last year's solution for fetching Apple iOS/macOS App reviews:
- Public URL API (RSS) ⚠️: Cannot flexibly filter, provides limited information, has a quantity limit, and we occasionally encounter data disorder issues, very unstable; might be deprecated by the official in the future
- Using [**Fastlane**](https://fastlane.tools/){:target="_blank"} **— [SpaceShip](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/spaceship){:target="_blank"}** to encapsulate complex web operations and session management, fetching review data from the App Store Connection backend (equivalent to running a web simulator crawler to fetch data from the backend).

Following last year's method, only the second method can be used, but the effect is not perfect; the session will expire, requiring manual periodic updates, and cannot be placed on the CI/CD server because the session will expire immediately if the IP changes.

![[important\-note\-about\-session\-duration](https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/continuous-integration/#important-note-about-session-duration){:target="_blank"} by Fastlane](/assets/e36e48bb9265/1*N6B1H_PdtB4bNDrX4BIYRA.png)

[important\-note\-about\-session\-duration](https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/continuous-integration/#important-note-about-session-duration){:target="_blank"} by Fastlane

After receiving the news that Apple [updated the App Store Connect API](../f1365e51902c/) this year, I immediately started redesigning the new review bot. In addition to using the official API, I also optimized the previous architecture design and became more familiar with Ruby usage.
#### Issues encountered during the development of [App Store Connect API](../f1365e51902c/)
- The [List All Customer Reviews for an App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/list_all_customer_reviews_for_an_app){:target="_blank"} endpoint does not provide App version information.

It's very strange, so I had to workaround by first hitting this endpoint to filter out the latest reviews, then hitting [List All App Store Versions for an App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/list_all_app_store_versions_for_an_app){:target="_blank"} & [List All Customer Reviews for an App Store Version](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/list_all_customer_reviews_for_an_app_store_version){:target="_blank"} to combine the App version information.
#### Issues encountered during the development of AndroidpublisherV3
- The API does not provide a method to get all reviews, only reviews added/edited in the last 7 days.
- Also uses JWT to connect to Google API (without relying on related libraries e.g. google\-apis\-androidpublisher\_v3)
- Here is an example of generating & using Google API JWT:

```ruby
require "jwt"
require "time"

payload = {
  iss: "client_email field in the GCP API service account key (*.json) file",
  sub: "client_email field in the GCP API service account key (*.json) file",
  scope: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidpublisher"].join(' '),
  aud: "token_uri field in the GCP API service account key (*.json) file",
  iat: Time.now.to_i,
  exp: Time.now.to_i + 60*20
}

rsa_private = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new("private_key field in the GCP API service account key (*.json) file")
token = JWT.encode payload, rsa_private, 'RS256', header_fields = {kid:"private_key_id field in the GCP API service account key (*.json) file", typ:"JWT"}

uri = URI("token_uri field in the GCP API service account key (*.json) file")
https = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
https.use_ssl = true
request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri)
request.body = "grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-bearer&assertion=#{token}"

response = https.request(request).read_body

bearer = result["access_token"]

### use bearer token

uri = URI("https://androidpublisher.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v3/applications/APP_PACKAGE_NAME/reviews")
https = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
https.use_ssl = true
        
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Authorization'] = "Bearer #{bearer}";
        
response = https.request(request).read_body
        
result = JSON.parse(response)

# success!
```
