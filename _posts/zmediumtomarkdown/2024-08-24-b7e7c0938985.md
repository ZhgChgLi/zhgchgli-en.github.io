### \[Travelogue\] 2024 Bangkok 🇹🇭 5-Day Free and Easy Trip

Returning to Thailand after the pandemic, a quick 5-day free and easy trip to Bangkok.



![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*kRZZjY_7_6WaKRkw9E74iw.jpeg)

#### Memories of Bangkok

Going back to 2018, it was the first company trip of my first job after entering the workforce, and also my first time traveling abroad, to Bangkok + Hua Hin \(5 days\); the following year in 2019, I went to Sabah with colleagues on another company trip; then the pandemic stole two years from us, and after it ended, I started going on crazy free and easy trips to Japan.

Back then, I was a newbie, with zero social experience, blindly following my older colleagues. I didn't even know what I could or couldn't bring on the plane. During security check, I absentmindedly placed my passport on the basket, and almost lost it when it fell off the conveyor belt \(if it had fallen into a gap, I wouldn't have been able to retrieve it\); that time, it was a mindless guided tour, mindlessly riding tour buses. My impression of Bangkok wasn't very clear, I only remember that the rooftop bar was great, the weather was hot, things were cheap, and massages were affordable. I had no concept of the geographical locations.

So, I always wanted to revisit Bangkok to relive the memories from six years ago. However, not being familiar with Southeast Asia, I was a bit hesitant to travel alone. **Coincidentally, at the beginning of the year, while bantering with Pinkoi colleagues, we ended up planning this 5-day free and easy trip to Bangkok.**


> _Details and fragments of memories from the 2018 Bangkok + Hua Hin 5-day trip are included in the appendix at the end of this document._

Because I started a new job in June, I didn't have much time for leisure activities. Mark and Sean were mainly responsible for arranging and planning, so I didn't do much homework.

> **_⚠️⚠️⚠️I have placed the safety and precautions for traveling to Bangkok, Thailand after the travelogue. You may skip the travelogue but it is essential to understand the precautions against scams and things to be aware of, especially if you encounter marijuana._**

#### Internet

Due to the rushed preparation this time, I hadn't arranged for internet access the day before and didn't have time to buy a physical SIM card. Fortunately, I tried eSIM for the first time and loved it after using it.

I directly purchased the [**Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} from KKday. After purchasing, I received the eSIM activation certificate and could start using it.

![Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*AnowISXXahXxykkUUsugFw.png)

[Thailand SIM Card | AIS 5G High-Speed Internet 8 Days Unlimited Data + Calls eSIM](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}
- Limited-time promotion: From now until December 31, 2024, activating it during the promotion period will double the high-speed data from 15GB to 30GB. After exceeding 30GB, the speed will be reduced to 384 Kbps for continuous internet access.
- Unlimited calls within the AIS network, 50 Baht call credit, and an additional 10GB (10Mbps) data for using Tiktok, Wechat, and Instagram for text messaging.
- **Has a physical number, can make calls, and receive SMS!**
- Calculation of days: Based on a 24-hour system, counting from the activation of eSIM, where 24 hours constitute a day (Thai time).

[Mainly for unlimited data usage, cheaper than physical SIM cards, 8 days for NT $232.](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/137037-ais-16-day-unlimited-data-esim-activate-before-may-3-2023-thailand?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### Flight Tickets 🛫
- Outbound: TPE 16:00 -> BKK 18:45
- Return: BKK 15:20 -> TPE 20:10

Airline: Thai VietJet Air

Price: `TWD $9,259` (including additional round-trip **15 kg** checked baggage)

Initially, I wanted to travel with my friends, but they didn't check in any baggage (ticket price was around `$6,000`), and later when I checked other airlines, I felt like I was losing out; the regular airlines were around `$10,000` during similar periods, not much of a difference, but much more comfortable!

In fact, Thai VietJet Air allows baggage to be carried without checking in. Passengers can bring two pieces of carry-on baggage with a total weight not exceeding 7 kilograms.
```
1. Carry-on baggage weight:
Each passenger (except infants) can bring 1 piece of their own baggage and 1 small carry-on baggage, with a maximum total weight not exceeding 07 kg.

2. Carry-on baggage dimensions:
- 01 piece with maximum dimensions of 56cm x 36cm x 23cm for carry-on baggage
- 01 small carry-on baggage (including the following items)
  + 01 bag for girls, magazines, cameras, bags for baby food, bags purchased at the airport with dimensions not exceeding 30cm x 20cm x 10cm, etc.
  + 01 coat with dimensions not exceeding 114cm x 60cm x 11cm when opened.
  + 01 notebook with maximum dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 10cm
```

> [_Information as of 2024/08/22, subject to the latest official announcements._](https://www.vietjetair.com/en/pages/baggage-policy-1607068164219){:target="_blank"}

Basically, carrying a backpack and dragging a carry-on suitcase is enough.

Left home around 12:30 pm after work.

![Departure](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*YsFObRlulrMFKHySvo3NAw.jpeg)

> _Remember to take the Airport MRT Express train, even if you take the regular train in the morning, it won't arrive earlier than the Express train!_

Arrived at Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1 around 1:30 pm.

![Taoyuan Airport](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*BBE4RhKU9tcJI427_LoQMw.jpeg)

![Boarding Pass](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ksagRFmStL9nLBWIyYY3Jg.png)

The check-in counter was completely empty, so I checked in and completed the baggage drop directly upon arrival.

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*GI5u8vhrNRbFdG-XqY_2LQ.png)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*CBOJ0KHI4dMmAP5REh1UaA.jpeg)

Once again, it's B1R, the furthest gate that requires taking a shuttle.

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XMQJOe1n5vyVdWQrYJpgNg.png)

It was still early before 4:00 PM, so I decided to have another meal at the airport. This time, I found out that I could order individual items at the restaurant, not just fried chicken as before!

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hfpWAbwiM2Aal3MZJ36oOA.png)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*XNjYtycibxeowQBaDT_jNw.jpeg)

I discovered that walking further ahead from the restaurant leads directly to the second terminal. So, if you have plenty of time, you can walk to the second terminal for food or come back to the first terminal to relax at the free VIP lounge.

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*t4dk8GQIv0D53N0V_qo7KA.png)

After buying food, I went to the free VIP lounge at the first terminal to rest and eat. This time, I saw people charging their devices. Last time I was here, all the power outlets were taken, but it seems they have fixed it now.

#### Around 3:30 PM, headed to the B1R boarding gate.

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*2Ros8CQBKj0-kkMugSZ7Hg.png)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*At7elbjIueB9lvvenvlfTA.png)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*fpzrwzWez_HwgKFuFmDAhA.png)

The flight information wasn't updated, showing 4:00 PM, but the actual departure time was changed to 4:35 PM.

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*puKndBRQgCKs3LKbXbzEWw.jpeg)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*zCT2uidCELNc7WL1NpW72Q.jpeg)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*1aGwmjed9srQtHli3uDoxg.jpeg)

Due to flight delays, the actual departure time was 5:13 PM.
- The seats on VietJet are similar in size to those on Tigerair, larger than Peach Aviation, but the chairs are uncomfortable, the faux leather material is not breathable, and sitting for too long can be painful.
- It seems you can bring your own food on VietJet. On the return flight, someone bought mango sticky rice and ate it onboard without any issues.

#### Arrived at Bangkok BKK Suvarnabhumi Airport at 7:30 PM.

I heard from colleagues that during peak hours at Bangkok Airport, you can purchase the [**Thailand Airport BKK Departure Meet and Greet Fast Track Service**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/160605?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for quick clearance. However, when we arrived, there were hardly any passengers, so the clearance was quick.

#### 8:00 PM - Collected luggage and exited the airport.

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*QDvOtf4PsS-jSESOkb-0AA.jpeg)

Possibly due to the budget airline, there were not many checked bags, so the luggage retrieval was very fast.

#### eSIM Network Setup

Upon exiting the airport, I started to figure out how to set up and activate the eSIM, only to realize...

> **_⚠️Activating eSIM requires an internet connection⚠️_**

It's like buying a pair of scissors but needing another pair of scissors to open it. Activating the eSIM requires an initial internet connection for activation. Luckily, a friend traveling with me had already activated their eSIM in Taiwan, so I borrowed their internet to activate mine. (There is also Wi-Fi available at the airport, so no need to worry too much.)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_xv7JB_yl7d47ljrUTpYdw.png)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6vg_zfmf6tr3SIBUj6gi4A.png)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*7-7yMcMgwbpNzBq1YgknaQ.png)

I found the eSIM activation page and simply long-pressed the QR code to select "Add to eSIM."

> **_For some reason, if you save the QR code to photos or notes, you won't have the quick add function. Another method is to send the QR code to a companion or print it out for scanning with your phone._**

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*hZBZoEJCLuHxEgbOVMEXBw.jpeg)

![Image](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*_MctPE8uZYOdX5vnYoJnvg.jpeg)


![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*KMKLtNg2Aaeug_cn5fitNQ.jpeg)

iPhone iOS eSIM manual setup path: Settings -> Mobile Network -> Add eSIM -> Scan QRCode -> Enter information manually -> Enter information in the message -> Use for. You can choose "Travel" -> Select "Travel" for mobile data usage -> Done!

After activation, it is equivalent to dual standby, but if the original number SIM card does not have a roaming plan, there will be no network before. **In case of emergency, you can switch back to the original SIM card number!**

#### 20:30 Airport Dining

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*mDPRItCdp28u5P6tTQelqQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*bgHNI9p20Jyf3t3IMDExMQ.jpeg)

Because it takes over an hour to get to the city and hotel, the budget airline does not provide meals. Everyone is hungry, so they decided to have dinner at the airport first.

They found a Thai restaurant to eat at, the shredded pork was spicy and refreshing, and the vegetable soup helped to ease the spiciness.

#### 21:00 Moving to the Hotel

> _👉👉👉You can refer to KKday airport transfer service:_

> _[- Thailand | Airport Private Transfer | Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) / Don Mueang Airport (DMK) - Bangkok/Pattaya/Hua Hin City Hotels](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/3431-bkk-or-dmk-bangkok-private-transfer?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cagHOMc-TKS9fmhN18zVOQ.png)

Around 21:00, they started moving to the city and hotel.

**Taking public transportation requires three transfers on the subway and BTS:**
1. Airport Rail Link `Suvarnabhumi` -> `Phaya Thai`
2. BTS Sukhumvit Line `Phaya Thai` -> `Siam`
3. BTS Silom Line `Siam` -> `Chong Nonsi`

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*OvL8K9OxwjMCVJ-3hYy2bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*-eJ_rrYns2teWCITXTnhTA.png)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*PeWlfQ6fd55mU1Ojk0isJQ.png)

- Airport Rail Link can only be purchased with tickets
- BTS Rabbit Card (BTS transit card) can be purchased and recharged at the ticket counter, and used for entry and exit at BTS stations
- Please note that **the Rabbit Card can only be used on BTS**, not on MRT or Airport Rail Link

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*EF3IK_FXS4n3igDOsJ0C4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*jY4Jg6_vGhAM5CjPrVM-Iw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*Dom8OdbMSRAAXtFpykCTZQ.png)

- Arrived at `Chong Nonsi` (later found out that this is the station for Mahanakhon Building!)

#### Walking to [JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](https://jckevin.com/){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*6VrvZBTlo2gjg_lY7oQG8w.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*cgv3HGHsAkH8WL_jA6qTsg.jpeg)

When getting off the BTS, don't rush to the overpass, you can cross the road from the overpass.

> **_I felt it was very dark along the way (not many street lights), and it was quite far to walk (15 mins / 1 KM). It can be quite scary to walk alone at night. Along the way, there is a 7-11 and a small night market. I bought some food at 7-11 to take back to the hotel._**



> _In addition, if you take a taxi, due to the two-way road and U-turn issue, the driver needs to drive a short distance past the hotel to the next gap before making a U-turn back to the hotel, so it's a bit troublesome._

#### 10:30 JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL

Arrived at the hotel around 10:30.

[![JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL](/assets/b7e7c0938985/43d8_hqdefault.jpg "JC KEVIN SATHORN BANGKOK HOTEL")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg24V_VS6oA){:target="_blank"}

The room is very spacious, it's a whole apartment-style room with a master bedroom, a guest bedroom, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony.

#### 2018 Memories

Taken in 2018 / iPhone 6

It's a coincidence that during the 2018 company trip to Bangkok, we all took a taxi to the rooftop bar at this hotel in the evening XD

They also offer a Sky Bar dinner package:

Since we were staying here this time, after putting down our luggage in the room, we went up to take a look.

As it was already past dinner time, we could only order some appetizers and skewers.

### 8/03 Day 2 - Wat Pho, Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Arun, ICONSIAM, Lhao Lhao, Rock Pub Live

#### Hotel Breakfast

Had breakfast at the hotel in the morning before heading out. The breakfast was okay, but not many choices.

#### 9:30 Departure

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*dZQvSlCNcBjgE4-mdnFZMQ.jpeg)

Due to the large number of people, we took a Grab (THB 135) directly to Wat Pho.

We passed through [Chinatown](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/blog/101689/bangkokchinatown?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} on the way, forgot to take photos, it had a very cyberpunk feel!

> _**⚠️Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded areas⚠️**_

You need to wear slippers to enter, and you can walk around the reclining Buddha in Wat Pho to pay your respects.

After leaving Wat Pho, we wanted to exchange some money. Only one friend had exchanged some Thai baht in advance, while the rest of us planned to exchange it in Bangkok. So, we first went to the nearby [The Old Siam Shopping Plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UPNxgoTmtswuhHVS8){:target="_blank"} to exchange money at SuperRich.

> _Exchanged NTD $5,000 for THB $5,200_

Khanom bueang Thai crispy pancakes

After exchanging money, we had some cash, so we replenished our energy at the food market on the first floor. We tried Thai crispy pancakes \(ขนมเบื้อง\), which were sweet with meringue inside, very similar to cotton candy, and also had banana pancakes. Finally, we bought a cup of iced coffee and continued our journey.

#### Grand Palace, Wat Phra Kaew

Around 13:00, after leaving the Grand Palace, we had lunch at a nearby western restaurant heading towards the pier.

#### 14:00 Getting Ready to Board the Boat to Wat Arun

> **_⚠️Outside the pier, there will be people trying to lure you onto private boats, charging high fees \(THB 500, 1000\) and not being safe; ignore them and find the official pier and counter to inform them of your destination._**

> **_The official fare is only THB 30 \(from Tha Chang to Wat Arun\), the new boats are air-conditioned, safe, and comfortable._**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*oc8bbW-4ZZwQeFkqNhXwNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*ccUJ7WKGfb73k8UWEDNesg.jpeg)

When the boat arrives, the staff will announce "Wat Arun" \(yes, in Chinese\), and you can always ask if unsure.

It's almost time for afternoon thunderstorms, and you can see the water flowing turbulently.

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*8hMHmiUOANTISYOVpTISiA.jpeg)

The boat is new, the air conditioning is cool, the enclosed space is safe, and there are frequent trips, making it very convenient!

Upon arrival, the staff will also announce "Wat Arun."
#### 14:30 Arrival at Wat Arun

Entrance Fee: THB 200

After disembarking, you will reach Wat Arun, where you can directly queue to purchase tickets for entry.

> **_⚠️There is a dress code at Wat Arun⚠️_**

> **_No sleeveless tops, shorts, exposed midriffs, or short skirts allowed._**

![](/assets/b7e7c0938985/1*MbiMV91xnwXQqSTg4UUx1g.jpeg)

ICONSIAM is large and luxurious, the food street on the first floor is very distinctive.

Continue walking to BTS Charoen Nakhon platform, thinking of getting a foot massage for an hour.

There is a newer and larger Thai Garden Massage outside the station (1), but no available seats; fortunately, continue walking to (2) another one as shown in the picture, which I find very comfortable, less crowded, spacious, quiet, and inexpensive (foot/1 hour/THB 270).

After the massage, with renewed energy, continue shopping and return to ICONSIAM; walk upstairs to the restaurant, which is also elaborately decorated with a jungle theme, small bridges, flowing water, and a waterfall, overall very nice!

> _Bought the famous Japanese TORO FRIES (long queue) to recharge._

This is a branch line with only three stations and fewer trains.

> _Google Maps seems to have no information on this BTS line; it suggests walking to Krung Thon Buri._

Take one stop from here to Krung Thon Buri, which is the Silom Line.

The boss seems to be Chinese? It feels like a fusion of Chinese and Thai cuisine, a highly rated old restaurant, and it seems to be a favorite of Blackpink's LISA.

Because I'm going to The Rock Pub for a live music session later, I had to eat quickly, but I found every dish delicious!
- Images 1-3, the background of the goose brand cooling jelly, like the minced meat, called หมูสับผัดหนำเลี้ยบ, seems to be minced meat stir-fried with pickled mustard greens, very appetizing!
- Image 2-1, fried oyster omelette, similar to the bomb oyster omelette at the Shilin Night Market in Taiwan.
- Image 2-2, seasonal limited drink, longan tea.
- Image 2-3, the most special curry crab (Panang Curry), made with a whole fresh large crab.

> _Recommended by Thai people, the goose brand cooling jelly, I later bought a can, it smells smoother than a mint nasal stick and is less irritating to the nasal cavity!_

After dinner, head to The Rock Pub for drinks and live music.

Four performances, all rock and classic songs!

I've heard songs from: Coldplay, Radiohead, Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Oasis, The Killers...

We left around 23:00 as it was getting late, and the whole performance was very impressive! Whether it was the singing skills or the live performance, I thought it was great! Very talented!

After returning to the hotel to give Chun-Hsiu Liu Taiwan souvenirs, we dispersed and went back to rest.

### 8/04 Day 3 Chatuchak Market, Wangwon Mahanakhon Building, Central Rama 9
#### 9:30 Breakfast: Wang Chunsheng Beef Hot Pot, Beef Offal Hot Pot

Early in the morning, we took a Grab to have breakfast at Wang Chunsheng Beef Hot Pot. The overall taste was quite Chinese/Taiwanese style, which I thought was good, but the beef soup in Tainan was even better.

> _After breakfast, we went to Chatuchak Market. Since it was quite far, we didn't feel like walking and transferring to the BTS, so we took an Uber directly there (THB 374)._

> 👉👉👉 [**_KKday Chatuchak Market | Bangkok Private Transfer Service_**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/182142?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}

#### 10:45 Arrived at Chatuchak Market

Chatuchak Market is large with many vendors, but it's clean and easy to shop around. However, there is a high repetition of items, and it seems like many are selling Made In China products for tourists.

In the end, I only bought a Thai brand, Phutawan indoor diffuser, as a souvenir.

When we got tired from shopping, we went into a massage shop for foot and shoulder/neck massages (1 hour/THB 250).

#### Restroom

If you need to use the restroom at Chatuchak Market, there are paid restrooms on the outskirts (THB 5 per use). I went in and found it very clean, with one person per stall, and they were constantly being cleaned. If you prefer not to pay for the restroom, you can also go to the Mixt Chatuchak mall on the outskirts, which has free and equally clean restrooms.

Seafood Rice

Lunch was casually settled at the restaurant in [Mixt Chatuchak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5PwQcFThBHtFpbzw6){:target="_blank"} mall, the taste was good.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*LeJHthehTAM7xdrlOLhETg.jpeg)

After eating, we continued shopping and bought a cup of durian juice to drink, the taste was rich and real, and the price was affordable (THB 89).

> _Later found that things at Chatuchak were actually cheaper, for example, mint nasal sticks sold here for 6 pieces at $99, while Big C sells 6 pieces for $140... and also durian juice, sold for over $140 at the city night market._

#### 15:00 Take BTS to King Power Mahanakhon Building

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*A4V3CL5XvLoQ4sp487pJuQ.jpeg)

Chatuchak is closer to MRT, but the King Power Mahanakhon Building we want to go to is at BTS Chong Nonsi station; it takes about 1 KM (15 mins) to walk from Chatuchak to the nearest BTS Saphan Khwai station.

#### King Power Mahanakhon Building (Bangkok Grand Kyoto Building/King Power Mahanakhon)

Ticket: THB 1,080/person

> _👉👉👉 [**Recommend buying tickets from KKday first, prices are cheaper: Bangkok King Power Mahanakhon SkyWalk Observation Deck Ticket (free cancellation 2 days before)**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20739-king-power-mahanakhon-sky-walk-bangkok-ticket?cid=19365){:target="_blank"}_

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*AJADLZZvKK4E4LXvuDWkYA.png)

Upon closer inspection, it is not as tall as imagined, but the architectural style is very unique, with a cyberpunk vibe.

Before entering, there is a security check, and after purchasing the ticket, free luggage storage is provided; backpacks are not allowed to be carried up (small waist bags are allowed).

_Free synthesized digital photos, there will be staff guiding the download after visiting the elevator_

The direct elevator has a 360-degree panoramic animation like Taipei 101 and Skytree; the height is about the same as Tokyo Tower.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*sP_hQ4hGSKCygeaSgltHpQ.jpeg)

Upon coming up in the elevator, you will first arrive at the indoor observation deck on the 74th floor, where there is a cafe and public seating for a short rest; to continue, take the elevator or stairs up to the 78th floor, which is the rooftop observation deck.

As soon as you arrive on the 78th floor, there is a small bar where you can order a drink and enjoy the view.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UQfqlK-yyirHCGU08P7xrQ.jpeg)


![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*PeqjUWSwE1Hh24qWkioTxA.png)

After coming out of the 78th floor, you can continue to climb up to the staircase, the rooftop resting area.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ka4Pl5OQcXwptpdj6JMEPA.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*f6oB_qelx6mxJQUDhyJoxQ.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*dFRAU2mY_Qp9T0ru4GngIg.jpeg)

From the rooftop, you can overlook the entire Bangkok, and you can imagine that the night view should be beautiful too!

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*f4eREu0dL79OzsYCtl1O9A.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*XOsqBu8PjCeB7XSlsD0_Fg.jpeg)

The staircase and rooftop resting area face the famous transparent glass corridor, where you can directly see the ground vertically. You can enter by taking shoe covers from the nearby box, but **bringing a mobile phone is prohibited. You can ask your companions or staff for assistance in taking photos.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9AVMpOE7sP7aJGdLbXXeFA.png)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*K2MOcxsrNbuNbz00sPfNOg.png)

The entire glass corridor is not very large, about the size of a rooftop infinity pool in a hotel. It doesn't feel very high when looking from the side, but you might still feel a bit nervous when actually walking up, feeling a bit weak in the knees. XD

### JJ Green Night Market (formerly known as Ratchada Train Night Market)

![MRT accepts credit card payment](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*BrfghHaJknyt6IiX7yOgbA.jpeg)

MRT accepts credit card payment.

To get to Central Rama 9, you need to transfer to the MRT underground at Phra Ram 9 Station. Rabbit cards cannot be used; you need to buy tickets or now you can use a VISA card to swipe in and out.

> _Tested with Taishin GoGo card, not tested with Cathay Cube._

For dinner, come here to find food. I have to say that Bangkok's night markets and bazaars outshine Taiwan by far. The overall environment is clean, with seating areas, not chaotic, well-planned, and very comfortable to stroll around.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*1cBlgC7kvmt1fWeMfiDVMA.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*OVMfzMU1HugpE0CVyUiSVw.jpeg)

After a stroll, I first had dessert on the left (similar to sponge cake?) and grilled seafood on the right, both with a chewy texture and quite good.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*31mIDWp4WgTX8TSK5Q-C4Q.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*K3ZN-Kiwz4yTiNHiZ3P1bg.jpeg)

Next up is the highlight, volcano ribs, with a unique taste. The sauce has a lemongrass spicy and sour flavor. Just grab it with your hands and bite directly, very appetizing!

After eating, I bought coconut ice cream + mango + peanut dessert at another stall, also delicious!

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GamIzqKB9ROnECRfhPfA1Q.jpeg)

After eating, return to Central Rama 9 for a stroll. Here, you can also find the famous NaRaYa Bangkok bags.

On the way back to the hotel, I happened to encounter the post-rain Bangkok with colorful digital advertising screens, the color contrast was maxed out, giving a very cyberpunk vibe.
#### 7-11 Hot Pressed Toast for Supper

On the way back to the hotel, I tried Thailand's [convenience store hot pressed toast](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/pack/347495){:target="_blank"} and Thailand's banana milk. The filling was melted cheese hot dog, and the crust was crispy! It was delicious and cheap!
### 8/05 Day 4 Central World, Big C, Terminal 21

> **_Didn't sleep well all night + hungover all day, feeling lost._**

#### Central World

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6_evilQk4T0LdCYSIgBudg.jpeg)

Woke up in the morning and went shopping at Central World.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Sp3TTqnEx3yn6IM4H38NsQ.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tmLvijY5Q7TVJbMo4D4XFg.jpeg)

As soon as I entered the first floor, there was SHAKE SHACK burger. I ordered the SHAKE SHACK signature burger and the coconut milkshake unique to Bangkok. The burger was delicious and not greasy, but I found the milkshake too sweet.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*OXOp4dN-5p9xS1ojcu0b9A.jpeg)

The place was huge, just like ICONSIAM. If you want to explore thoroughly, it's endless... I bought a shirt on a whim.

#### Big C

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GWD-HcYbLfAQEAN99tErsw.jpeg)

After Central World, I went to Big C across the street to buy snacks and souvenirs. (There were many options, but I didn't find them cheaper...)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Bda3BGHI_ZeylIS96UNcWg.jpeg)

![Bottom left Phutawan indoor fragrance diffuser was bought at Chatuchak yesterday, but I think department stores in the city also have it.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*aMillKlyevVx8fDncaurSA.png)

Bottom left Phutawan indoor fragrance diffuser was bought at Chatuchak yesterday, but I think department stores in the city also have it.

Also, it seems that Big C no longer provides plastic bags, so you have to buy an eco-friendly bag in the store.

> _The durian chips come in a big pack, but when you open it, there are only two small packs... but they are quite delicious._

#### Lunch

Outside Central World, there was a food market event at the plaza, not just simple stalls, but with a theme. This time it was Titanic-themed, and you could enter for free by following their official Youtube channel; the interior was also beautifully decorated.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9iurlEySgDL-ZQZzVGDiug.jpeg)


#### Afternoon: Returned to the hotel for a nap because of lack of sleep and hangover... just too tired
#### Dinner at Terminal 21 Department Store

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*8_lDD7yaIYIq7HV4zG4ClA.png)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*1T7njk_JYMi1eP1oMbjH-w.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*giNbQ1GPda-qPFaA8yQ7sQ.jpeg)

Terminal 21 is a place you can never finish exploring. Each floor has a different theme, for example, the Japan section mainly sells Japanese products and restaurants.

The main purpose was to meet up with [Chun-Hsiu Liu](https://medium.com/u/72361fccaa43){:target="_blank"} at the food street upstairs for a meal. \( **Highly recommended food spot that is cheap and delicious** \)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZyuBXqyjZtLw5zyVmarw6w.png)

At the food street, you find your own seat, and many locals also come to eat.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*a4MnqcM5Bi9jRPC3T29s5A.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*sYc87mPtI1nf3-9pk_F13w.png)

> _⚠️ **Regarding payment here, the shops do not accept direct payment. You need to go to the counter first to exchange cash for a food card, then pay with the QR code on the food card; after eating, return to the counter for refund without any deposit or handling fee.**_

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*rt81B-Pc31OZeMlgG5M38Q.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*k1vmadbwhdJsJNmkllarLQ.jpeg)

There are many choices, just queue up, state your order number, pay with the food card QR code, and you can also take away \(I remember there is an additional THB 10 for packaging\).

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Ol8uiQNEnE9tuZc-qbgqgQ.jpeg)

Ordered seafood stir-fried noodles \(THB 50\) + pork cutlet with fries \(THB 59\) = THB 109

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*t2R762mSI8CeoDWpSAuEKg.jpeg)

After eating, also took away a box of mango sticky rice as a late-night snack back at the hotel.

It's really delicious and cheap!!! A meal at a restaurant outside would cost at least 200-300, but here it's mostly THB 50-80 per meal.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*G4G79vwVWj592tOApWbK2g.jpeg)

After eating, went to [Benjakitti Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmKhQpbw9KTtLYeN8){:target="_blank"} at the back to walk around and look for the legendary [Bangkok giant lizard](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%A8%E8%9C%A5%E4%BD%94%E9%A0%98%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8-%E8%A2%AB%E5%B0%81%E6%B3%B0%E7%89%88%E4%BE%8F%E7%BE%85%E7%B4%80%E5%85%AC%E5%9C%92-104942584.html){:target="_blank"}; maybe because it was night, didn't see a single one.

Back at the hotel, a friend bought some mangosteen to taste. I found the fresh ones delicious, with a subtle sweetness and the flavor of mangosteen, very palatable. Later, we tried dried mangosteen, and the taste wasn't as good, just dry and sour.

> **_Regarding durians, durians in Bangkok are not cheaper... They cost around THB 200 - 300 per room._** 

### 8/06 Day 5 Return Journey
#### Bangkok Giant Lizard

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6oX4YygURRzsrDmv_OAJ2Q.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*E0M71hXTtQmzl2YP6kgPtw.jpeg)

In the morning, still curious, I specifically went to [Lumphini Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n53FhsjXUUJLnghn6){:target="_blank"} to find the legendary Bangkok giant lizard. Due to time constraints, I only found a medium-sized lizard basking in the sun in the morning.

> _Looking for the giant lizard was just a personal, boring activity for me. Locals reportedly dislike this type of lizard (water monitor lizard), as they eat dirty things. Do not touch them casually._ 

#### 12:00 Pick up luggage and head to the airport

The flight at 15:20, we had to leave at noon. It takes about an hour from the city to the airport.

> _👉👉👉 You can refer to KKday airport transfer service:_

Grab fare from the hotel: THB 577, need to take the expressway; the driver will pay the toll first, and the Grab card fare will be adjusted later with the toll fee. (I remember it was around THB 50)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ENH0G1_tBNWy-8RHV9XCag.jpeg)

Checked baggage limit is 15 kg, managed to stay within the limit.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*eTEGYVJWr25O5A2Jkjgqiw.jpeg)

Departed around 13:20, Bangkok airport security is quite strict, everything needs to go through security check, and almost all carry-on bags need to be manually inspected.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*7IrLBQONyc2Y0APyRYH9wQ.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*za7tCNofre_onuRLrAZaAQ.jpeg)

Upon exiting and passing through security, there was about an hour left to grab something to eat; found a Thai restaurant and had the last meal in Thailand \(seafood fried rice, mango juice, mango sticky rice\).

> _After exiting, many shops sell take-out boxes for mango sticky rice, so you can buy some to eat on the plane if you're still hungry!_

> _**\(⚠️But remember not to bring it back to Taiwan⚠️\)**_

This bottle of water deserves a close-up shot because the budget airline didn't provide anything, so I thought of buying water at the airport to drink on the plane. However, the mineral water after exiting cost THB 70 - 100 per bottle, and this one was THB 100.

BKK is huge... full of Trip.com advertisements. I arrived on time for the return journey and took the shuttle to catch the flight.

### Back to Taiwan

Arrived at TPE Taoyuan International Airport, picked up luggage around 20:45, and went directly to take bus `1841` or `1819` of Kuo-Kuang Motor Transport back to Taipei, very convenient without the need to transfer.

### ⚠️Safety and Precautions for Traveling in Bangkok, Thailand⚠️

Safety is the most important thing when traveling. Here are some safety and precautionary tips.

#### Beware of Scams

[![Eight common scams in Thailand, some people are still falling for them!](/assets/b7e7c0938985/07b5_hqdefault.jpg "Eight common scams in Thailand, some people are still falling for them!")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42r-bg16Fg){:target="_blank"}

The following are summarized from a video by Bangkok Cat, and I actually encountered the money exchange/scam during this trip.
1. Incorrect bill calculation
Always double-check the total amount when ordering.
2. Initiating conversation to see your country's currency or asking to exchange money
They distract you while you take out your wallet and then steal or snatch it.
3. Falsely claiming that attractions are closed outside the Grand Palace or other places, and enthusiastically recommending you to take a tuk-tuk to other \(Black Temple/Black Shop/ **Take a private boat, encountered this at the pier this time** \) places to scam you into spending money.
4. Tuk-tuk drivers, shouting prices sky-high, suddenly increasing the fare halfway through
If you want to experience a tuk-tuk ride without being scammed, [you can try the new MUVMI app for tuk-tuk booking](https://bkk.com.tw/muvmi-app/){:target="_blank"}
Even if the tuk-tuk looks good, beware of scam #3, where they recommend you to visit attractions or take a boat.
5. Fake waitstaff, while waiting in line, fake waitstaff will enthusiastically invite you inside
They will introduce the menu in your language, take your order, ask for payment upfront, and then run away with the money.
6. Motorcycle or scooter rental scams
Do not leave your passport as collateral. If they claim damages and demand compensation, it will be troublesome if they have your passport. Look for reputable rental companies and take videos of the vehicle condition before renting.
7. Scams on local social apps
You might meet ladyboys, fortune tellers, or scammers.
8. Ping pong show scams, enthusiastic promoters on the street will ask if you want to watch a ping pong show, just buy a 100 THB drink, then they will take you to a dark alley or upstairs to a shady place.
It's not worth it, and when you want to leave, they will demand 3,000 THB, claiming there was no 100 THB deal.
9. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded places, even in areas where you need to buy tickets to enter \(e.g., Grand Palace, Wat Pho\).

#### 🌿🚬

It will be banned next year, but here are some experiences to share.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️Consuming edibles \(like gummies\) can be potent, and the scary part is that when you eat them, you might not feel anything at first, but it can hit you suddenly after a few hours⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- It's best to start with a gradual approach, eat 1/3... wait a few hours... if nothing happens, eat 2/3... wait a few hours... if you feel something, try eating 1 piece...
- When smoking, also start gradually based on your tolerance.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️It's strongly recommended to try it in your hotel room, so you can rest if needed, which is safer⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Drinking alcohol doesn't mean you're more tolerant.
- **⚠️⚠️⚠️Your heart rate may increase uncomfortably⚠️⚠️⚠️**
- Have someone awake to take care of you in case of any issues, for safety.
- Only smoke in specific places.

#### Others
- Thailand is not a tipping culture, so generally, you don't need to tip; I only tip THB 20 for massages as a gesture.
- Alcohol is only sold from 11:00 to 14:00 and 17:00 to 24:00; it's prohibited to sell alcohol all day during Buddhist holidays.
- Not all hotel balconies allow smoking, so be sure to ask.
- Foreigners can call emergency services in a foreign language at `1155`.
- SuperRich has operating hours, so if you arrive too early or too late, you won't be able to exchange money.

A colleague (2024) also mentioned that Bangkok has many trendy cafes, which are quite extravagant. If interested, you can check them out. This cafe had low ratings and has closed down.

Only took a few photos of the hotel, one of which was a surprising photo of a millipede found in the bed upon waking up in the morning.

### Day 2
#### [Santorini Park (Closed)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5e56XAK4en27bHbPA){:target="_blank"}

[![](https://www.bring-you.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/huahin-travel-24.jpg)](https://www.bring-you.info/zh-tw/santorini-park){:target="_blank}

Seems to be a small amusement park and shopping mall with Greek-style scenery.

#### [Hua Hin Artist Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UcF7Wd82aHq4aGP86){:target="_blank"}

A quite famous attraction, still in operation in 2024.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*F0ArV4D6xV9P93xS-6bz0Q.jpeg)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*RhWB5E_AxO7P-3LheSaG8A.jpeg)

There are many paintings and artworks.
#### Enjoy the facilities and beach at the Sheraton Hotel.


Hotel is in villa style, each one is standalone, the swimming pool can surround every room in the hotel, there is a bar next to the pool; the outside beach is undeveloped, a desolate area.


After dinner, go to the nearby night market.
### Day 3
#### [Maeklong Railway Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jsbm5FFwYf2ArEW36){:target="_blank"}

It was too early, everyone gave up and didn't go.
#### [Damnoen Saduak Floating Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKSTmHgaHc4YCbpZ6){:target="_blank"}

It was quite exciting and adventurous, even though the water was murky and had a smell.
#### Head to Bangkok for a 2-day stay at [Marriott Queens Park Bangkok](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bzq2EGFrsxsRTKpj9){:target="_blank"}


#### [HEALTH LAND](https://www.healthlandspa.com/cn/home){:target="_blank"} 2-hour full-body Thai massage


The guide specifically told the shop not to step on the back, only remembered it was very high-end, but it hurts and can't sleep while being massaged XD
#### [River City Shopping Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L3Pnv1BpLCpcGs7G7){:target="_blank"}

Because I have to go to the Chao Phraya Princess River Cruise for a buffet dinner tonight, I first went shopping at the department store near the pier.
#### Chao Phraya Princess River Cruise Buffet Dinner

The food was decent, but the night view was beautiful, you could see the lights of the Bangkok Riverside Night Market Ferris Wheel.

After returning to the hotel, I went to the bar upstairs at the Marriott for a drink, I only remember the beautiful night view and cheap drinks.
### Day 4 Free Time

I remember going to the department store, Big C, and Central World.
#### In the evening, went to [Zoom Sky Bar at Anantara Sathorn Bangkok Hotel](https://www.kkday.com/zh-hk/product/105589-zoom-sky-bar-anantara-sathorn-bangkok-package?cid=19365){:target="_blank"} for a drink

This is the hotel I stayed at this time XD

### Day 5 Return

This is the memory of the 2018 employee trip. This time I revisited Bangkok on a fully independent trip, which made me more familiar with this city. Compared to my previous impression, I feel that it is more prosperous, the food is better, and the prices are higher.
