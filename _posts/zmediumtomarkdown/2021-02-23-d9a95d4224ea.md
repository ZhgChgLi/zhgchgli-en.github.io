A series of ups and downs, this feature was opened in 2012, then closed; reopened in 2021, announced closure again in 2022; recently in 2024, it's back again, and the official complete setup guide has been updated. You can refer to the latest official documentation for setup, [and refer to this article for the domain registration process](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"}.

[Custom domains are back!](https://blog.medium.com/custom-domains-are-back-2dee29560d59){:target="_blank"}

Medium's official blog announced on 2021/02/17 that Medium is once again allowing creators to bind their own domain names! Whether it's a creator's Profile page or Publications, both support customization.
#### What is a "Custom Domain"

To ensure that readers from all backgrounds understand, here's a simple explanation of what a custom domain is.

A domain is like an address in the online world; if I enter the address Medium.com, I will go to Medium; now, creators can customize their domain, which is like customizing their address. You can register the address you want and then link it to your Medium account to replace the original address; for example, I use [blog.zhgchg.li](https://blog.zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"} as my address, and it will lead to my Medium page.
#### History

Research shows that this feature was available in the early days around 2012, with a one-time $75 setup fee. However, when I started writing on Medium in 2018, this feature had already been discontinued. Existing users were not affected, so sometimes when browsing Medium, you may see a domain that belongs to you but the website is hosted on Medium, which is pretty cool. It was rumored that this feature was launched for a while and then taken down, possibly due to commercial considerations as having a custom domain could reduce Medium's visibility.

#### Benefits
- **Visibility**: A custom domain can bring many benefits to creators, the most straightforward being visibility. Instead of using medium.com/@xxxx, you can display your name directly, for example, zhgchg.li.
- **Flexibility**: If you decide to move away from Medium and host your own website in the future, you can redirect the original links to the new site.
- **Domain Authority**: This is related to SEO search result rankings. By using Medium to build the authority of your domain, you can transition to other platforms without worrying about starting from scratch with SEO.

#### Drawbacks
- You lose the high **Domain Authority** SEO ranking advantage of medium.com, which may significantly impact incoming search traffic in the early stages.

#### Rules

I noticed that when sharing links to articles, if the article is part of a Publication but the Publication does not have a custom domain set, or if the Profile's domain is not used, the link will revert to the default medium.com link.

#### My Setup

Here is an example of my setup for reference:
- Profile Page: [blog.zhgchg.li](http://blog.zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"} (I only use the subdomain `blog.zhgchg.li` because the main domain serves another purpose)

> **_I initially set up a Publication page, but later removed it_**. _Since I have few followers and limited ability to generate traffic on my own, I heavily rely on search engine traffic from Google and others. If the Publication page also used a Custom Domain, the article links would be under my domain, but my domain is not well-established yet, resulting in poor search rankings and low traffic._

> Setting up only the Profile without a Publication has its advantages. The original medium links can still be indexed by Google, and having a link with your own domain allows for a balanced approach. You retain your existing traffic while gradually building the Domain Authority of your domain.

#### Target Audience

Building authority for a domain takes a long time. I believe this feature is most suitable for those who already have a website service (e.g., musicplayer.com). If you want to build a community, you can directly use Medium, and in this case, a domain like blog.musicplayer.com can be used.

The two scenarios where this feature is suitable are: 1) using the Medium platform to write articles (with increasing customization options) and 2) having a domain with enough Domain Authority that won't significantly affect SEO.

### Pricing
#### Domain Part:

You can obtain a domain from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} (used as an example in this article) or Godaddy based on your preference. The common price range for a .com domain is approximately $200 to $500 TWD per year. The price varies depending on the domain suffix, length, and rarity, with some rare domains costing millions or even billions.

Domain registration operates on a first-come, first-served basis. Unless a domain name is protected by a trademark in a specific region, it is usually a race to register it. If someone else registers it first, you may need to negotiate a purchase. This has led to a practice known as domain squatting, where individuals register numerous domains and hold them without use, waiting to sell them to others.

Domains require annual payments or can be purchased for multiple years, but there is no option for a lifetime purchase. If you fail to renew the domain, it will be released after the protection period, allowing anyone to register it again.

However, Medium users are unlikely to encounter domain squatting issues, as most users are individuals. I registered using my online account zhgchg.li, which had not been taken. If you do encounter duplicates, you can consider changing the suffix to something like .div/.net, etc.

For the suffix part, you can refer to the [List of Internet Top-Level Domains](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E9%A1%B6%E7%BA%A7%E5%9F%9F%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8){:target="_blank"}, but having a suffix listed does not guarantee availability for registration. It depends on the regulations of the domain's country and whether platforms like [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} or Godaddy sell domains with that suffix.

For example, .li is the domain for [Liechtenstein](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%97%E6%94%AF%E6%95%A6%E6%96%AF%E7%99%BB){:target="_blank"}, and currently, there are no restrictions on who can register a domain. Only [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} still offers this domain for sale.

Benefits of being named Li?

> _By the way, my spelling zhgchg\.li is also called [Domain Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack){:target="_blank"}; a better example is google =&gt; goo\.gl._

#### Medium Section:

The one-time $75 setup fee has been canceled, and it has been changed to be available for all Medium paid members (monthly $5 / yearly $50); but I actually prefer the original one-time setup fee QQ; because I am mostly a creator and do not need the subscription privileges of paid members, the monthly and yearly fee system is more burdensome for me, and I am starting to consider joining the paywall project Orz.

#### Update on 2021/04/05

What happens if you join the membership plan first and then do not continue to renew after setting up a custom domain?

> After testing, the custom domain remains valid even after the membership expires!

### Getting Started
#### 1. Purchase & Obtain a Domain Name (Using [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} as an example)

First, go to the [**Namecheap official website**](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} to search for a domain name you like:

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*rMdeqUtI_mqhu4E0S9-hrg.png)

Get search results:

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*onP_MBBew5tEznz0Jlplog.png)

If the button on the right says "**Add To Cart**," it means the domain name is available for registration and can be added to the cart for purchase.

If the button on the right says "**Make offer**" or "**Taken**," it means the domain name has already been registered, so please choose a different suffix or a different domain name:

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*3R6HAQgpimJ33bax6ywe0g.png)

After adding to the cart, click on "**Checkout**" at the bottom.

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*Xcm3dGx100WOYUcpgBFT9w.png)

Proceed to the order confirmation page:

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*vfmnXvEaFubrAHHMaRy6hw.png)

- **Domain Registration**: Here, you can choose `AUTO-RENEW` for automatic renewal each year, or you can choose to purchase for a specific number of years.
- **WhoisGuard**: Since [domain information can be publicly accessed by anyone](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/whois/result?domain=google.com){:target="_blank"} (registration date, expiration date, registrant, contact information), this feature allows you to display Namecheap as the registrant and contact information instead of your personal details, which helps prevent spam messages. (This feature may incur charges for some suffixes, so use it if it's free!)

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*AZ3Evt6kFyzKNYepeVW7cw.png)

Here are some whois information results for google\.com, which can be [checked here](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/whois/result?domain=google.com){:target="_blank"}.
- **PremiumDNS**: We know that a domain name is like an address, meaning when you see an address, you know where to go; this feature provides a more stable and secure way to find the location, but I think it's unnecessary unless it's for a high-traffic e-commerce website where no errors can be tolerated.

Enter credit card information and click on "**Confirm Order**."

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*2l-4pmtoyKepXD3nvKxRPw.png)

You have successfully made the purchase!

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*NMFFKl7SyCVi3v1ZFZFT1Q.png)

You will receive an order summary email.

#### 2. Setting Up the Domain (Using [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} as an example)

After logging into your account, click on **Account in the upper left corner** \-&gt; " **Dashboard**"

![](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*BHbXLRSqCjCZyf6ynHlvww.png)

Enter the "Dashboard" and switch to the "Domain List" tab, find the Domain you just purchased, and click on "Manage".

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*xIK5jsLCbnc7jgmuwUyLug.png)

Once inside, switch to the last tab "Advanced DNS".

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*FsXSsQThWhh_Y93L5zqsFQ.png)

**Keep this page open and go back to Medium.**

Go to the [Medium settings page](https://medium.com/me/settings){:target="_blank"}, locate the "Profile" section, and click on "Get started" in the "Custom domain" part.

> _For Publications, go to Publications' "Homepage and settings," and at the bottom, find the "Custom domain" section._

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*vjun5sB8zRWjbo_xK_iIWg.png)

If it shows "Upgrade," it means you need to upgrade to a paid user to use this feature.

**Access the settings page:**

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*pnD2kJPixXfREUNcmsdFRw.png)

Enter your Domain name, e.g., `www.example.com`.

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*W4litf2WcjZ-G8HwLVhLkg.png)

**Remember this information and go back to the Namecheap settings page.**

In the "Advanced DNS" tab, locate the "HOST RECORDS" section.

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*OW3qjvxYXCzSo6UuPvkAcg.png)

Click the "ADD NEW RECORD" button twice to add two new data fields.

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*NnjyygCAcH2st_7M-Is39A.png)

Enter the information from Medium:
- Select "A Record"
- If you are the main domain (e.g., zhgchg.li), enter www; if you are a subdomain, enter the subdomain name
- Enter the IP same as the information on Medium

Click the checkmark on the right to complete the addition.

Check again if there are records in the "HOST RECORDS" section.

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*PuoZ0zUuFcn6VcyUulZq0A.png)

**If there are records, the Namecheap setup is complete. Go back to the Medium settings page.**

Click "Continue" to proceed.

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*j1HD1RdsVFPk5myB5ZSsGA.png)

If you see the processing page, it means the setup is complete!

![Image](/assets/d9a95d4224ea/1*FJSLUp4TWM2qbjIw8ZIw9g.png)

Note that it may take up to 48 hours for the Domain binding DNS settings to take full effect. Accessing the domain may show a 404 error if not yet effective.

### Attention

Sharing links with a custom domain that is later changed may cause previously shared links to become invalid.

### Minor Issues

As of 2021/02/24, there are still some issues to be resolved by Medium:

[Custom domains are back!](https://blog.medium.com/custom-domains-are-back-2dee29560d59){:target="_blank"}

But I believe it's already functioning correctly 99%!

What happens if you cancel the paid membership... will it expire directly?
