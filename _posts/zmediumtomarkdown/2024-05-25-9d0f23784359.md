### Plane.so Free Open Source and Self-Hosted Project Management Tool Similar to Asana/Jira

Introduction to the Plane.so project management tool and its use with Scrum processes



![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*BQgytUYomqHcD33LWA-ZaQ.png)

### Background
#### Asana

I first experienced the power of the Asana project management tool at my previous company, Pinkoi. Whether it was internal project management or cross-team collaboration, Asana played a crucial role in decoupling dependencies between people and tasks, thereby enhancing collaboration efficiency.

At my previous company, every team from the product team to the operations and business teams (e.g., HRBP, Finance, Marketing, BD...) had a publicly accessible project as a single point of collaboration. When other teams needed assistance, they could directly create a task (or from a template task) in the project (usually there would be a "Need Help!" section). The receiving team would then take over and arrange the task.

Cross-team collaboration with the operations team, such as procurement and recruitment processes, could be directly managed through tasks and tracked for progress. Collaboration with the business team, such as marketing campaign planning or tasks requiring engineering assistance, was also streamlined.

**Without Asana or a similar project management tool:**
- We would need to communicate directly with the other team for everything. Direct communication is most effective for P0 matters, but in daily operations, 90% of tasks are not P0. Direct person-to-person communication for everything is inefficient and disrupts the workflow of others.
- Task execution would be non-transparent, with only the communicating parties knowing the progress. For multi-party tasks, progress would need to be repeatedly confirmed through communication. Additionally, supervisors would find it difficult to manage tasks and allocate resources effectively.
- Task arrangement would be chaotic. We receive many tasks daily with varying priorities and directions. A tool helps collect and categorize similar issues for future resolution and makes it easier to identify important tasks for daily work.
- Task handover would be problematic. A tool records task details and execution status, allowing others to quickly take over tasks when needed.

Returning to project management, Asana provides flexible, multi-dimensional, and automated project management tools that can be customized as needed.

> There are many ways to use Asana. The following are just a few examples. It is recommended to identify your needs first and then find relevant Asana examples to apply.

> Asana's Taiwan distributor also offers comprehensive training. Contact them if interested.

**Example 1**

![Team Project](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*BH_lsGILJFpyUHDgGam3cw.png)

Team Project
- To Do: Tasks to start this week or next week
- In Progress: Tasks currently being executed
- Review: Completed tasks awaiting Sprint Review
- Backlog: Task pool from which tasks are selected weekly for execution

![Team Scrum Project](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*ETtOn0T-dLraFbI5nP6uZA.png)

Team Scrum Project

In addition to the main team project, a separate Scrum project is created to arrange and review tasks for each Sprint (Asana tasks can be added to multiple projects simultaneously).

**Example 2**

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*xgmWK9YuWkAH9NxQoZle4Q.png)

Example two uses sections to differentiate Sprints. A new section is created each week, and tasks are dragged into it. Labels are used to mark other statuses.
#### Back to Reality

As mentioned earlier, the above scenarios describe the use of the Asana project management tool at my previous company, Pinkoi. Returning to an environment without a project management tool in the past few months has made me even more aware of the importance of such tools for work efficiency.

Currently, the environment lacks modern project management tools. Due to procurement (need to control expenses), internal control issues (pure intranet), and personal data audit restrictions (must be on-premises), it is not possible to directly use Asana.

Given the above environmental constraints, we can only focus on open-source and Self-Hosted project management tools. The solutions found include Redmine, OpenProject, Taiga... After trying several sets, the results were not as expected, with missing features and unfriendly UI/UX. Until accidentally discovering a new project management tool, Plane.so, launched in January 2023.

**By the way, I recommend this website, which includes many services that support Self-Hosted:**

- Plane.so x Scrum Workflow Example
- Appendix

You can view it according to your needs. For Docker Self-Hosted setup tutorial, please refer to the next article "[**Plane.so Docker Self-Hosted Setup Record**](../9903c9783a97/)".

### Introduction to Plane.so
#### Overview

[![](https://plane.so/og-image.png)](https://plane.so/){:target="_blank"}

Plane was established in 2022, originating from Delaware, USA, and India. Currently, observing [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/planepowers/){:target="_blank"} and [Github](https://github.com/makeplane/plane){:target="_blank"} activities, most developers are in India. The company has raised $4 million in seed angel funding (invested by OSS Capital).

[![](https://plane-marketing.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/plane-assets/blog/star-growth-plane.webp)](https://plane.so/blog/how-we-got-to-20k-github-stars){:target="_blank"}

Currently, Plane occupies the first place in the [project management category on Github](https://github.com/topics/project-management){:target="_blank"}, using the [AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/makeplane/plane#AGPL-3.0-1-ov-file){:target="_blank"} for open source. The first version was launched in January 2023 and is still in the development stage, with no official release version yet.

> **Please note:** ⚠️ **Open source does not mean free** ⚠️. Like Github and Gitlab, there are many project management tools similar to Github products, such as Asana, Jira, Clickup, but there is not yet a sufficiently good open-source product comparable to Gitlab. Plane's goal is to become the Gitlab of project management tools.

- Updates the development version approximately every two to three weeks, with some adjustments potentially having significant differences or security issues.
- Temporarily does not support multiple languages (Chinese).
- Supports [Self-Hosted](../9903c9783a97/).
- **Currently, the official version does not provide export from Cloud to Self-Hosted. It can only be achieved through API integration. Therefore, if considering Self-Hosted on-premises use, it is recommended to use Cloud only as a trial version.**
- macOS App, iOS App, and Android App are also under active development.

**For Plane Product Roadmap, refer to [official website information](https://sites.plane.so/plane/459cfcdf-dc9c-49a6-9d4b-a89f91440189/?board=kanban){:target="_blank"}:**

#### Solution

Plane offers a cloud version service, starting at $0, with Pro providing more frameworks and integrations, and automation features.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*sjk-v_qOAWFppWG1zcFpOQ.png)

[Additionally, the official team is promoting a $799 early lifetime plan. Interested teams can refer to this link for paid support](https://plane.so/one){:target="_blank"}:

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*AzRTMK-xbYx1SuSjXzI2fw.png)

Community Edition (officially abbreviated as CE version), Self-Hosted version, also starts at $0. **If you want to use advanced features, you still need to purchase Pro but it can support Self-Hosted**.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*qJF4m66lrL74zZVjn5fzNQ.png)

#### Framework

Plane.so is different from Asana's multi-dimensional flexibility but Plane is composed of the following frameworks for project management:
- Issues: Similar to Asana Task, any work is created as an Issue and then arranged for processing or used as a record.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*pIAY63Q2gldFKfGJSce2qQ.png)

- Cycles: Similar to Sprint, a time cycle or version of an iteration, each Issue can only exist in one Cycle.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*FWPbQUefbahYxaTiIlpawA.png)

- Modules: Project, module, classification functions, each Issue can be added to multiple Modules.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*R5tZxXT5Tu0WgMfy-xcxnQ.png)

- Layouts & Views: You can view Issues using Gantt charts, calendars, Kanban, lists, and Sheet modes. You can also save filter conditions and display methods as Views for quick access.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*R5tZxXT5Tu0WgMfy-xcxnQ.png)

- Inbox: Issue Proposed process, you can create proposal Issues, and only after approval will the Issue be officially created and executed in the project. If not approved, it will be directly discarded.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*pYH9rsIMI34wBIBv0hxfXg.png)

- Pages: Simple documentation function, can record some work and product matters.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*_8OiZDYMGTYrEfj_eRypfw.png)

- Drive: Similar to Google Drive team file function.

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*uEMf9QnbPmbVJ5fuq-NFmw.png)

Currently, the free version and CE (Self-Hosted) version do not have this feature.
### Plane.so Operation Tutorial

We can quickly and freely start using the Plane Cloud version:

[**Plane \| Simple, extensible, open-source project management tool.**](https://app.plane.so/){:target="_blank"} 
[_Open-source project management tool to manage issues, sprints, and product roadmaps with peace of mind._ app\.plane\.so](https://app.plane.so/){:target="_blank"}
#### Workspace

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*yxtGND6xaZk8ey3vuvqMiw.png)

- The first time you enter Plane.so, you will need to create your first Workspace.
- A Workspace is similar to an Asana workspace; one account can join multiple Workspaces.
- If a small company uses it across teams, they can use the same Workspace.
- If a large company uses it across teams, Plane does not have features like Asana's Team function or Project grouping function; using the same Workspace can lead to project confusion. It is recommended to use Workspaces to distinguish between teams.

**After creation, you can switch between different Workspaces using the Workspace dropdown menu, and you can also enter Workspace Settings from there:**

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*uKD3DSeeZdEzS3meTqGhiw.png)

**Settings include:**
- General Workspace avatar, name, URL
- Billing and plans payment information, upgrade plans
- Integrations third-party integrations, currently the free version only offers Github and Slack integrations
- Imports import functions, currently only Jira and Github Project imports are available
- Exports export functions, currently only csv, excel, json formats are available
- Webhooks API tokens, self-integrated API

**An important setting is Members, where we need to invite team members to join the Workspace:**

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*as1_IkYpiBHu7uB6ftuZIw.png)

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*xPF2Bdp8KywAOR4AoyXWbA.png)

Roles:
- Guest/Viewer currently have no significant difference in functionality, can only view Issues, Comment, and Emoji; if they are external users outside the organization email, they are Guests, and if they are within the same organization, they are Viewers.
- Member can operate all functions
- Admin can enter Settings

#### Home

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*dy4oF2haCVir8iU5OYGq3A.png)

### Plane.so x Scrum Workflow Example
#### Structure

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*nVLBpAXVa3NB1nhnqD3BwA.png)

- Each team has its own Workspace
- Each team will have a main product Project
- Projects: Other projects can be created such as marketing advertising Project, customer support Project, or external collaboration Project, separate from the main product development Project
- Modules: Create Function Modules (design, frontend, backend, App) for Team Lead to track, or create Modules for OKR or project goals (increase conversion rate, OKR-1 increase GMV…)
- Cycle: Create Cycle according to Sprint cycle, assuming one Sprint per week, you can create `W12` or create according to the Monday date `2024-05-27`
- Since it is currently not possible to automatically create Cycles, you need to create future Cycles monthly or weekly in advance
- Any work needs to open an Issue
- If possible, add Start Date & Due Date, Modules, Priority to the Issue
- **If an Issue keeps switching between In-Progress & Cycle (cannot be completed in one Cycle), consider breaking down the Issue for easier project management**

#### Process
- **Sprint cycle: one week**
- Backlog: Open Issues for any work or ideas, State = Backlog, **fill in Estimate, Priority**
- **Weekly Sprint Planning Meeting: Select Issues from Backlog and ongoing Issues (To Do or In progress), set Priority/Estimate, arrange for this Sprint execution, and add to Cycle**
- If there are urgent Issues during the Sprint, they also need to be directly added to this week's Cycle
- Daily Stand-up: Spend 15 minutes each morning quickly sharing the status of Issues
- Change the status to ToDo/In Progress when Issues are ready to be executed or started
- Change the status to Done when Issues are completed, or create an additional Review State
- **Weekly Sprint Review Meeting: Simply review this week's Issues (not planning for next week), quickly review completed Issues, and ensure Estimates are filled in for future statistics.**
- Try to ensure all Issues in the Cycle are completed by Friday, **choose to add unfinished Issues to the next week's Cycle or move to Pending/Cancel**.
- Continuously iterate the above process to manage all Issues and Projects

### ⚠️⚠️Disclaimer⚠️⚠️

> The above is just a workflow example. Please note that there is no perfect process, only the process that suits your team. Refer to the structure provided by Plane.so to creatively find the best project management method.

### Appendix
#### API

Plane.so has a clean front-end and back-end separation architecture, so it has a complete API that can be used. After creating API Tokens from Workspace Settings, you can use them by adding the API Request Header `X-API-Key`. For API Endpoint request methods, refer to the official [API documentation](https://docs.plane.so/api-reference/introduction){:target="_blank"}.

> However, since the official documentation is not yet complete, many request methods are not listed in the documentation. The quickest way is to open the browser tools to check Network requests and see how the official requests the API, then use your own Key to use it.

#### Issue Comments, Submitting Immediately After Selecting Chinese Characters

Opened an Issue with the official team & checked the Source Code. It seems the chances of fixing this are quite low because the need for character selection wasn't considered initially, so the Enter key event is directly bound to submit the Comment.

**Browser Extension Workaround:**

Here is a workaround JavaScript script I wrote to hook the Enter event.

1. First, install a JavaScript browser injection extension:

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1TSw8ZPwr2VvUZlY1cbAPOWo5cisrfpazmTpfGH4YWGTLCJLUq23LMSKuS5ee-bBP5C0GL8wsbpV9iQ9zLEQ6Dv8Vw=s128-rj-sc0x00ffffff)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld){:target="_blank"}

The above is a Chromium shared extension, and other browsers can search for similar JavaScript Inject tools.

2. Go back to Plane.so, click on the extension -> click on the "+"

![](/assets/9d0f23784359/1*Ho5_6Qhd4_qU2Srhtoq7Qw.png)

3. Inject the following JavaScript into Plane.so
```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️Security Issues⚠️⚠️⚠️

> Since Plane.so is still in the development stage and the product is very new, it is uncertain whether there are any security issues. It is recommended not to upload any sensitive data to avoid data leakage in case of major problems with the service, or use [Self-Hosted](../9903c9783a97/) for local intranet use only.
