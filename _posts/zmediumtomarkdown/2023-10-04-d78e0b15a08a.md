### \[Travelogue\] 2023 Kyushu 10-Day Solo Trip

Kyushu 10-Day Solo Trip: Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Kumamoto Overview

### Preface

At the end of August, I officially left Pinkoi, where I had been for almost 3 years. I had been thinking about leaving for a while. Earlier this year, I thought about taking a break, going out to relax, and then coming back to reassess the situation. So, I went with friends to "[\[Travelogue\] 2023 Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe & 🇯🇵 First Landing](../76d66c2e34af/)" and with colleagues to "[\[Travelogue\] 2023 Tokyo & 🇯🇵 Second Landing](../9da2c51fa4f2/)". But after returning, I felt an even stronger urge to truly break free. Just as I finished my tasks, I mustered the courage to step out of my comfort zone and seek the next new challenge!

"[\[Travelogue\] 9/11 Nagoya One-Day Flash Trip](../7b8a0563c157/)" was purely accidental. As mentioned in the text, it felt more like a march than a relaxing trip.

Taking advantage of a rare break, I decided to explore Japan once more. The original plan was to go with a friend who was also between jobs on a **🇰🇷 Busan ➡️ 🇯🇵 Fukuoka ➡️ 🇯🇵 Kumamoto route**. We would go to Korea and return from Kumamoto, taking the [New Camellia](https://journey.tw/new-camellia/){:target="_blank"} from Busan to Fukuoka, which takes 12 hours overnight, covering both commuting and accommodation.

My friend found a job in September and started working, and I couldn't find a new travel companion in time. Not wanting to move around too much alone, I decided to drop the 🇰🇷 Busan ➡️ 🇯🇵 Fukuoka segment and changed it to 🇯🇵 Fukuoka ➡️ 🇯🇵 Kumamoto, entering through Fukuoka and returning from Kumamoto.

Starting in October, my time became fragmented, and I also wanted to start preparing for a new job in October, so I set the departure date at the end of September (9/17–9/26).

### Summary / Retro

As usual, I'll write the summary and review at the beginning. I saw a phrase in a free travel group that I really liked: "Free travel is about constantly paying tuition (spending time or money) to learn. The more experience you have, the fewer pitfalls you'll encounter."

👍
- Fresh cola, peach water, FamilyMart's fruit drinks, and autumn plum wine are delicious!
- Japanese professional baseball is worth watching! Remember to buy seats that are either empty or near the aisle, and cheap seats are fine.
- JR Pass may not always save money, but it did save a lot in Kyushu! At least saved over 1,000 TWD.
- Solo travel also led to many interesting encounters; for example, helping a Japanese family and receiving a souvenir from Mihara City, a kind foreign sister offering to take photos, meeting a Taiwanese family on a boat trip, walking with a TSMC brother in Aso, helping a family take photos in Kumamoto and meeting them again at the airport to take more photos... etc.
- Kumamon is everywhere in Kyushu (not just Kumamoto).
- Kyushu is very spacious and not crowded. Famous eateries and attractions rarely require queuing, which is very comfortable.
- My Japanese improved slightly; I can understand numbers (though I still use Google Translate to confirm), understand if I need a plastic bag, know phrases for checkout, this one, that's all, cash, credit card, and tax-free requests (XXX お願いします).
- Completed writing the travelogue!

👎
- This time, I stayed at a bad hotel:
When looking for hotels in Japan, it's still important to check reviews, especially low-score reviews, to see if you can accept them. Also, use street view to see if the location is convenient.
- I spent too many days in Kumamoto this time; 2 days would have been enough. The other days could have been spent in Oita. Fukuoka and Kumamoto are actually much closer than Fukuoka and Nagasaki:
Usually, I find accommodation first and then attractions, but Kyushu is vast; I should find the places I want to visit first and then arrange accommodation to visit more attractions.
- Fukuoka's accommodation options, prices, and quality are much better than Kumamoto's.
- I missed the Yufuin festival this time (I went to Nagasaki that day):
Next time, I should check if there are any festivals on the dates I'm traveling. Everyone recommends festivals, so I must go.
- JR Pass allows you to take the Shinkansen, but not the "Nozomi" or "Mizuho" trains; you need to pay extra for those.
- Solo travel + language barrier can be quite lonely, often leading to self-reflection and enjoying solitude.
- Solo travel accommodations are more expensive.
- I still rushed through attractions this time; I should slow down and enjoy the moment and find good food. Especially in Japan, famous restaurants are closed after meal times.
- The sun in Kyushu is still very strong this season, so proper sun protection is necessary.
- Northern Nagasaki is average (Dutch, Chinatown), while Southern Nagasaki and the night view are more distinctive.

### Preparations
#### Travel

Initially, I considered entering and exiting through Fukuoka, with a one or two-day round trip to Kumamoto (which later proved to be the right choice XD, as there aren't many attractions in Kumamoto). I found a China Airlines flight entering Fukuoka and returning from Kumamoto, which was also $1,000 cheaper, so I decided on this flight.

Since I had plenty of time, I chose the most luxurious schedule, departing at noon and returning at noon, for a total of 10 days including flight time.
- Outbound: 9/17 CI 116 16:40 TPE -> 20:00 FUK
- Return: 9/26 CI 2195 ([9/26 New Route](https://event.liontravel.com/zh-tw/chinaairlines/index){:target="_blank"}) 12:30 KMJ -> 13:34 TPE

Price: **$10,048**

Since Kyushu is vast, I bought the [JR Pass Northern Kyushu Rail Pass](https://www.klook.com/zh-TW/activity/2371-jr-kyushu-jr-pass/?clickId=9f9b35054f){:target="_blank"} (5 days), thinking that it would be worth it no matter how much I used it.
#### Accommodation (9 nights)

When arranging the trip, I didn't think too much or do much research. I just thought that I hadn't been to Fukuoka or Kumamoto, so I split the stay roughly in half: 5 days in Fukuoka and 4 days in Kumamoto.

[**Fukuoka 5 nights— Benikea Calton Hotel Fukuoka Tenjin**](https://www.agoda.com/zh-tw/benikea-calton-hotel-fukuoka-tenjin/hotel/fukuoka-jp.html?cid=1844104){:target="_blank"} **( [Benikea Calton Hotel Fukuoka Tenjin](https://www.agoda.com/zh-tw/benikea-calton-hotel-fukuoka-tenjin/hotel/fukuoka-jp.html?cid=1844104){:target="_blank"} )**


![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*6WNdqS0fAb8NOn79hG7_xQ.png)

- Price: $7,583, $1,516/night
- Transportation: From Hakata Station, you can take the Nanakuma Line subway to Watanabe-dori Station or take a bus and walk 5 minutes to the hotel.

JR Kumamoto -> Hotel


![Hotel -> Kumamoto Airport](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*WapnHlitUflFJEykcWznKg.png)

Hotel -> Kumamoto Airport

Finding accommodation in Kumamoto was difficult (perhaps because they were all booked by TSMC business trips), with fewer options, higher prices than Fukuoka, and older facilities. Finally, I found this relatively inexpensive hotel.
- Price: $8,157, $2,039/night
- Transportation: From JR Kumamoto Station, transfer to the Hohi Main Line and then take the tram to the hotel (Shiritsu Taiikukan-mae Station). **The return trip to the airport is also very convenient, with a direct bus to Kumamoto Airport.**


With the hotels booked, you can fill out the online [Pre-Entry Application](../76d66c2e34af/).
#### Fun

**The original plan was as follows:**
- 9/17 21:00 Arrive in Fukuoka, 22:00 Arrive at the hotel, probably just stroll around the outdoor food stalls
- 9/18 Nagasaki (Shinchi Chinatown/Holland Slope/Glover Garden/Oura Church/Gunkanjima Digital Museum/Meganebashi Bridge) not all of them + Atomic Bomb Museum + Peace Park + Inasayama Summit Observatory at night for the night view
- 9/19 Yanagawa, Dazaifu day trip + LaLaport Fukuoka (optional)
- 9/20 Mojiko, Kokura Castle day trip + food stalls
- 9/21 Shopping in Hakata (Fukuoka Tower, shrines, Canal City, Tenjin Underground Shopping Mall...)
- 9/22 Shopping in Hakata + move to Kumamoto + Suizenji Jojuen Garden
- 9/23 Kumamoto city, Kumamoto Castle, meet Kumamon
- 9/24 Aso Volcano day trip
- 9/25 Shimabara Castle, Shimabara Three Shiba Inu (very far, considering)
- 9/26 10:00 Kumamoto Airport, 12:30 flight back

#### Go!

> [Flight Tracker, iPhone Suica usage, Visit Japan pre-entry application... mentioned in previous articles, so this won't be elaborated here.](../76d66c2e34af/)

**This time was also very impulsive, bought the ticket and booked the hotel on 9/10, planned the itinerary on 9/15, and departed on 9/17!**

### Day 1 Departure

The flight was at 16:40 in the afternoon, so there was plenty of time to get up slowly and leave slowly.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*56nCHSI-rbX3tPMwbDcSRg.jpeg)

After arriving at Taoyuan Airport MRT A1 Taipei Main Station, I chose to use the in-town check-in service. I completed the check-in and baggage drop-off directly at Taipei Main Station, so I could go straight to the departure gate at the airport without queuing at the counters \([For in-town check-in information, please refer to the official website](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/ITCI/mobile/index.html){:target="_blank"}\).

This time, I also placed an Airtag in my checked luggage to track its location, which made it convenient and worry-free in case of lost luggage or while waiting at the baggage carousel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*-nIFAK7u_6p-LnkhEA3V6A.jpeg)

Arrived at the airport around 13:00 and wandered around after passing through immigration.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ewBdzikh22mnp_ucoRm0gg.jpeg)

Had an expensive and mediocre meal of mouth-watering chicken, and checked the luggage location; the luggage had also arrived at the airport with me.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*gislgU11QBimgS9N8txJsQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*i77TZ0ooiHCE5cBwpsLrHw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ZGbZ8VD8IaKod7rErIVNpg.jpeg)

After eating, it was only about 14:30, so I casually bought a Japanese book to cram.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SG7-jys-zW6o75RlimFoKA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8KzjM6OWaKCLIojiUTfuzA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*WfZd9deoaDEmrskkoXQPiA.jpeg)

Encountered other planes taking the wrong runway, causing the entire airport to reset; the plane circled around before taking off, resulting in a delay of almost 30 minutes; the old plane had a very small TV.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*mkX2qNrBXN2yur_rPbsbdg.png)

The osmanthus oolong tea was also quite good.

Due to the flight delay, I only left the airport around 21:00.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*n3lI2GX5YyaltKnSTcakIw.png)

After leaving the airport, you can see a sign indicating the direction and bus stop to wait for the bus; besides going to Hakata, you can also go to other places. Refer to [this article](https://carolblogtw.com/fukuoka-airport/){:target="_blank"} or the [official website](https://www.fukuoka-airport.jp/tw/access/bus.html){:target="_blank"}; if you are going to a distant place, remember to check the schedule.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*0nkVxPYO-eEWwThWus1Wzw.jpeg)

Originally planned to take bus No. 2 directly to Hakata Station, but it seemed like the last bus had already left or I had to wait another hour (I forgot), so I switched to bus No. 1 to Fukuoka Airport Domestic Terminal (Fukuoka Airport Subway Station), then took the subway to Hakata and transferred to the Nanakuma Line to Watanabe-dori Station.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*UVQjogUlXohb6VE7UlM1OQ.png)

#### Hello Fukuoka!

The hotel I was going to stay at is on the left side of the second photo.

Hotel mini review: Overall, it's a bit old, the lighting is dim, the soundproofing is average, and the air conditioning is slightly noisy, but it's still clean and tidy. However, I do regret not spending a bit more to stay at the nearby APA chain hotel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8u9eCa1nq5UxAV-acxyOvA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Cm_9kJWIgj9gai3p3_f5Pg.jpeg)

Originally planned to visit the food stalls on the first night, but was too tired, so I just grabbed something from a convenience store and went to bed early to prepare for the next day's itinerary.

### Day 2 Nagasaki

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*zpI5hLSzOSGi9PF_55bAiw.jpeg)

Morning view of Fukuoka city from the bed.

#### Hakata Station

Taking the subway to Hakata is too complicated, it's faster to walk to Watanabe-dori and take a bus to Hakata.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Hh2uKnW5LOxr3rMm_gJUqA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*VrtZ-2BmRfE6i4O9pAHC-Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*6lQeBVnwqX_RGVxKpv4jiQ.png)

After arriving at Hakata, first go to the manual counter to exchange the JR Pass (show your passport) and reserve a seat for Nagasaki. There are many foreigners exchanging JR Passes, it took almost an hour to queue, so it's recommended to go early or exchange in advance.

> I bought a five-day pass, which starts from the day of exchange. You use the main pass (the one with the date and amount) to enter and exit stations. The reserved seat ticket only shows your seat and cannot be used to enter or exit stations. Keep the main pass safe, you'll need it for all five days, and if you lose it, it's gone!

There are two segments from Hakata to Nagasaki. First, go to Takeo Onsen, then transfer to another train to Nagasaki. The transfer is on the same platform, and the train schedules are well-coordinated, so you just walk across to the other side to board.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*cI0jD1E3tCg7E9V6363cvg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*c9EfwoqERxFzuja4HRSMlw.jpeg)

While waiting for the train, I noticed that Kyushu trains are very unique!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OYHKAqia_USajIQg9mtfFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BppaK4ObuJjcoEwAqZqJ7w.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SU23c3I-iQCPi2WsMVpGJQ.jpeg)

The seats are very large and comfortable, and you can enjoy the scenery from the window.

**Travel time: about 1 hour 50 minutes**

**Little episode: Completed a bit of citizen diplomacy ✅**

> During the ride, a family sat next to me. The parents were taking their two kids out for a trip. One of the kids suddenly vomited halfway through the ride. The father didn't have tissues and had to use a newspaper to clean up, so I handed him some tissues and wet wipes.

> When getting off the train, the father gave me a souvenir from Mihara City (shrimp rice crackers).

#### Nagasaki Station

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Xp1rdLz4dD0usrC8CtbqVQ.jpeg)

After exiting Nagasaki Station, the weather was great! I was initially worried it would rain today.

After exiting, head towards the Nagasaki tram direction.

#### Nagasaki (South)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*V_xgDt2K73DSpBc5W063kA.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*h4UJDTlqk4ayv69IfY-MhQ.jpeg)

The first stop was Nagasaki Shinchi Chinatown.

It might be a unique spot for foreigners, but for Chinese people, it's just okay. They sell Nagasaki specialties like pork belly buns, champon noodles, sara udon, xiaolongbao... but I wasn't very hungry at the time, so I just walked around and left.

Walked towards Glover Garden, passing by the Confucius Shrine XD

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*vsjibVbJQUSDQFfiwdEbIw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*eN25xDjrhsFLYIax1QagEg.jpeg)

Passed by the Dutch Slope (just a slope), then took the escalator up to the No. 2 entrance of Glover Garden. The whole terrain is a large hillside facing the sea.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Zmdc7_8w8_tnGZaumArXdQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GjHniudZCGHSrhQ2Kn-L_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*vp_ePOP7s4FFCn26N540wQ.jpeg)

Walked around Glover Garden, admiring the architectural style and interior decorations. It felt a lot like Fort San Domingo in Tamsui (because both were built by the Dutch).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OqXN3ys-ZReuALDZETnO3g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Bu3xUvR49gK2mnHopeVUGA.jpeg)

Finally, don't forget to redeem the free photo, from here you can also overlook the cruise ships in Nagasaki Port.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*_rbT_Tpd_jmkVEdUCdogTA.jpeg)

On the way down the mountain, you will pass by Oura Catholic Church. I didn't go in, just took a photo and left.

I bought a Nagasaki pork bun to try, but I still think Taiwan's is tastier!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*tCwkrsHM-8L7x5LisYkRmQ.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GaT9e4OG9q1Wo0fcXf4dng.jpeg)

On the way back north to the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, I first got off at Megane Bridge to take photos. The reflection in the water from the front is really beautiful. If you have time, it's worth a shot.
#### Nagasaki (North Side)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SNDwEmMdLUnw8Yy7yDq4XA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*N9M1TVKf-6wF6h8T7KhXnQ.jpeg)

Visiting the Atomic Bomb Museum is more about immersion and reflection. The museum has designed many scenes (from the time of the explosion or immersive ones), installation art, historical data, and interviews; allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the historical atmosphere of the time and reflect on the cruelty and horror of future wars.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*IHy4429UVvl_Ai4s6J-YZw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4r2bAjoFadw8YSvOjwbH_w.jpeg)

After leaving the museum, walk forward to the atomic bomb explosion site, Peace Park.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3NltbSXG6tUGgjOFIzE9gw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*a0fu-k7LR7NVqCe1soNSLQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*c11oO0Qx_DgLEx3I-8m_4A.jpeg)

Along the way (including the Atomic Bomb Museum), many colorful paper cranes are hung to symbolize the prayer for peace.
#### **Inasayama Night View**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*tgN1b_oj4mFRPnGD_NJJrA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hXfIlA4TtnrFHcI1IG55ZA.jpeg)

After leaving Peace Park, I first went to Komeda's Coffee for a short rest, preparing to see the **Inasayama Night View, one of the world's top three night views.**

Checked the bus schedule, walked a short distance from Komeda's Coffee to the bus stop to the Inasayama Ropeway Station (Fuchi Shrine Station), and then strolled to the station to wait for the bus.

Unfortunately, the bus was delayed. This small station doesn't have an electronic display, and Google Maps showed the bus had left but I didn't see it; waited for more than 5 minutes and thought maybe there was no bus today, so quickly checked other nearby stops that go to Fuchi Shrine, then walked another 10 minutes to another stop to catch another bus.

> Funny thing is, halfway there, I saw the delayed bus coming... but it was too late Orz

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*vZGtQE4euYrwu5i8bxZT0g.jpeg)

After getting off the bus, Fuchi Shrine is right across the street. Walk straight up, pass through the kindergarten, and you'll reach the Nagasaki Ropeway (Fuchi Shrine Station). Since I didn't plan to stay too late, I bought a round-trip ticket (cheaper, but if you stay too late, there will be no ropeway, and you'll have to take the bus back).

[![Nagasaki Ropeway 2023/09](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/43a3_hqdefault.jpg "Nagasaki Ropeway 2023/09")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzLj8Rn4ivU){:target="_blank"}

It feels a bit like Wulai -> Unzen Amusement Park.

After getting off the ropeway, there's another sightseeing ropeway you can take, but I didn't try it, so I walked straight towards the observation deck.

[![Inasayama Observation Deck 2023/09](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/a74f_hqdefault.jpg "Inasayama Observation Deck 2023/09")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tCSsd_56ug){:target="_blank"}

I forgot to take photos of the observation deck. It's a 360-degree tower where you can see the entire Nagasaki city, port, and mountain scenery, and no ticket is required; you can watch the sunset from the port on the west side to the city night view on the east side.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rpwQhmKmdfMRqxsCcVnWTQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*aHbbBeWs5G87eJBoc15hbQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ycWNGvWsqoS6ROfArtxV-A.jpeg)

The observation deck is very large, so there's no need to worry about crowds.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rIEfhPB64RxFtrxHkKmMWA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pt48qVqxvITyyeINh_FYvg.jpeg)

After sunset, you can see the night view of the entire Nagasaki city and the station, which is very beautiful.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*h8VaTQr7FlA0nhg6ch7hCQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Kkcs8UwsaDpHuHs1mORa5g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Pvrc0k6RBDoYPQvTGbcF6g.jpeg)

Finally, take one last look at the night view of Nagasaki Station and buy a Nagasaki Castella cake as a souvenir (later found out it’s also sold in Hakata, with a shelf life of about 12 days, so it’s better to buy it later...), and get ready to return to Hakata.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*meR_ji4M4iPwwGOTYLOQGQ.jpeg)

Encountered another delay, this time with JR (signal failure); it was delayed by almost an hour before arriving in Hakata (already exhausted), and the driver drove very fast, making it feel shaky.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sSHNwn8zYwS6gcGbdXFGvg.jpeg)

Bought a late-night snack and went back to the hotel to rest.
### Day 2 Yanagawa Dazaifu Day Trip + LalaPort Fukuoka

In the morning, first go to the Fukuoka (Tenjin) Tourist Center to buy a one-day pass ([available at Fukuoka Tenjin, Yakuin, or online](http://www.ensen24.jp/kippu/tc/dazaifu-yanagawa/){:target="_blank"}), you can calculate if it's cheaper.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*EYq5MxPjRuJdXt0hVofBEQ.jpeg)

Additionally, you will receive two coupon books, **the Dazaifu one has a coupon for a free Umegae Mochi**.

There is no fixed order, but the boat tour has a time limit, and there are no tours after 2 PM; so just follow the process: Fukuoka -> Yanagawa -> Dazaifu -> Fukuoka.

After buying the ticket, go to the manual ticket gate, show the ticket to the staff, and you can enter the station and take the train directly to Yanagawa (no seat reservation needed).

**Travel time: about 1 hour 10 minutes**
#### Yanagawa Boat Tour

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*UlWumJgWsyi7QftJDbr78g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*mTGFMm5RQGhLbLZkGN13Wg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hSQUTKmOmOrupH0xRp3dmg.jpeg)

After exiting the station, you will see staff wearing white vests (if not, there is a service center nearby where you can ask). They will give you a map + return method + timetable and directly guide you to the shuttle bus to the boat dock.

Exit the station through the manual ticket gate, and the staff will tear off the ticket from Fukuoka to Yanagawa Station.

Initially, I thought I could walk the route, but upon exiting the station, I saw staff guiding us, so I took the bus.

While waiting for the next boat at the dock, I happened to meet a Taiwanese family traveling, so I joined them and chatted along the way (since I was traveling alone and don't speak Japanese, I hardly talked to anyone in Kyushu).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*yFZMXWoaQAgjvmmGNQMqMA.jpeg)

The water is very clean, and although the greenery in this season isn't as beautiful, there are fewer people.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*lkMz97RFZuHfYKSqcDNVKQ.jpeg)

The boatman will introduce the scenic spots along the way and sing songs (most Taiwanese will have heard them, many old songs).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*y7eBDIYyOC9ukc976EPBhA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*FoQ4C7vtGV2vS3fYL1df8Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*KVdn-gO4LkKe4BUaVNY9Xw.jpeg)

When passing under a bridge, the boatman will ask everyone to lower their heads to avoid hitting it, which is quite interesting; there is not much shade along the way, so it can be a bit sunny.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MuA9m0apTy9YM_Za4gPXoA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*j4EsiAPOto1nTJaoy2wCsw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*IbqgTkCF6KbqmdNfTE31MQ.jpeg)

There will be an ice shop selling fruit ice along the way, where you can buy one to cool off; the boatman will also give everyone an ice pack to cool down (very considerate).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MS8uJsLk7oQIqc3wMEPijw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*oem9fbgUykeVyEQbxathQA.png)

I chatted with the father of a Taiwanese family in front of me along the way and even got a business card at the end.

After getting off the boat, I couldn't find a free shuttle bus seat and ended up in the wrong line for another shuttle bus (not the Nishitetsu pass) and was refused boarding; it's better to study the map for the boarding point (Kawafuru Boat Station (Okinohata)) or ask directly.

I later walked to take the bus back to Nishitetsu Yanagawa Station.
#### Dazaifu

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CaTfG56LYBguxdMhJJz1sg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*P-KvZh9Eksj9nJ8dA2QWDg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*EV3vuJEGjlMKocB-RmG0Pg.jpeg)

From Yanagawa to Dazaifu, you need to transfer to a train to Dazaifu at Futsukaichi Station (you need to go to another platform).

**Travel time: about 1 hour**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*PpKs_TM4aa71gThwa-XBeg.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*piNmkE4dzUWnbjr4UuRqBg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*You2qpKtRydrco2vGB1MOA.jpeg)

Take the Tabito train to Dazaifu, passing through Gojō (2.5 stations); it's somewhat similar to the Beitou to Xinbeitou line, with just one train running back and forth.

One of the carriages has an exhibition of Dazaifu artifacts and a place to write postcards, worth checking out.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8H_Fg7aRMhS51IW92Tq4Sg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pTTWzqPljA7XTAxc66iwgg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3Ya_TWp3Um9FO1AGiAnUag.jpeg)

Dazaifu Station is also very beautiful, and the Lawson outside has a very Japanese feel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Fy3bL_xW3WcWkhnHN8wHJA.jpeg)

To the right after exiting the station is the world's only pentagon-shaped (Japanese 合格) Ichiran Ramen.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*jAg-p4pWUmGZTBB_GzscOA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4shsKlSI5a8sH_kZOSVWrw.jpeg)

After eating ramen, have a Umegae-mochi, which doesn't have much to do with plums, more like grilled red bean mochi. It tastes best when freshly made with a crispy skin, delicious!

I forgot to use the exchange coupon from the Nishitetsu pass and spent 150 yen to buy one myself; the shelf life is only one day, so I couldn't bring it back to Taiwan.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*03FKPTOUM3ixyGJH6q84vQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*srmvCC9_m6VqzyzClIl7Vg.jpeg)

Continuing along Omotesando towards Dazaifu, you'll pass one of the most beautiful Starbucks in Japan. The space is quite large but also crowded, so I didn't stay long.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*TSuNOEiB5p3iKiwSsobnbw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rn3LBP5JoyXGyIlSrc96Kw.jpeg)

The bridge leading to the shrine should be quite photogenic at night + with fewer people. Too many people, just snap randomly.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*i-5T__GVT98BKIIYr-MY9g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*AhntXw3R9tsP4PdWPD1N8A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GZgD39SPXkmdOoZP-hQI0A.png)

After visiting the shrine, return to Dazaifu Station and head back to Fukuoka Lalaport.
#### Fukuoka Lalaport

First, return to Futsukaichi from Dazaifu Station, then transfer to a train heading towards Hakata. Get off at Ohashi (Fukuoka), exit the station, and find the Lalaport direct bus on the left side. One stop and you're at Fukuoka Lalaport.

**Total travel time: about 50 minutes**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*bX9Z6aTpmzZ6Fx1XrPM09A.jpeg)

Upon arrival, you will see the giant Fukuoka Gundam outside.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*_6ENxMHmrrX0qQBScWXGBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*B70QuI9XspRVyJFX4yyjug.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*NdikFoZkjqp5PjCtv4udEA.jpeg)

Lalaport is very large, great for shopping and family-friendly; there's a big playground upstairs where kids play and people relax.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*5iYK2l03UU9ukNYzXy1CDA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3d9MLxuds5AVFnPTRVzi4A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uDEx5fHs8B_PqP-r52Jopw.jpeg)

Upstairs, there's a Jump Shop selling Weekly Shonen Jump merchandise, including Haikyuu, One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, etc. Bought some Jujutsu Kaisen items.

If you spend over 5000 yen, you can get a tax refund, but it seems to be refunded to their app or something, which is a bit complicated, and food is not included.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Y-TGFdRWA68x7hQRX-ehIg.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GyluxRa-WsWXBCi1nyc3gA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OV9vZbnrr4hAdm8R8PmDAQ.jpeg)

Went to the food court to eat Miyazaki beef bowl, and bought some snacks to take back (curry bread, Jusuian Daifuku) when leaving.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pUUNxUKS1d7wxq7JAYdZoQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*f-KaaW1uJgbGGkW1qW3Pvg.jpeg)

The Gundam lit up at night is still quite impressive.

**For the return direct bus, it's not at the original drop-off point. Follow the signs inside the mall to the bus stop inside the mall.**

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*fnCYg71dDVxOFftZbagc1g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CLBqxxhQdFr6SOK5cQ3JUQ.jpeg)

Back to the hotel to rest, using my own tablet (the TV is too old and not smart); the curry bread is crispy and delicious with meat filling, and the Daifuku is also good, but I prefer [Benzaiten](../7b8a0563c157/).

### Day 3 Mojiko, Kokura Castle, Canal City Hakata, Nakasu Yatai

In the morning, head to Hakata Station, take the JR to Mojiko, and then return to Kokura Castle.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*xnP4BV7BopjaW0i7P6MeLg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*z_Js8q61ur3RH--blv7rlg.jpeg)

![[Hakata to Kokura Transport](https://www.bobblog.tw/fukuoka-to-kokura-transport/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*6OcPE4rlWM7NvVKr5BxHsg.jpeg)

[Hakata to Kokura Transport](https://www.bobblog.tw/fukuoka-to-kokura-transport/){:target="_blank"}

**A little episode**
Without paying special attention to Google Map's planning, I took the **Shinkansen Nozomi 20, which JR Pass holders cannot take**; couldn't exit the station, had to pay an additional 2,160 yen guided by the station staff to exit. But it was indeed fast, reaching Mojiko in just 15 minutes.

#### Mojiko

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*RJ6qovuNTjbt6n7icFUoAw.jpeg)

Arrived at Mojiko without any trouble (was worried about getting fined).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*nV-GJFPB66WA5_iSfcj6pA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3TjVqygHlIbVgLOdi5K0RQ.jpeg)

Walking straight out of the station leads to Mojiko. On weekdays, it's completely empty; I happened to catch the Blue Wing Moji Bridge being lowered.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ngbx4pRfKIz6rkSxLuL1Vw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*j53FUw7WrYh_mCyrJjd2HQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*gK1xI52WIn1zqyo0Utaj0g.jpeg)

After the bridge is lowered, you can walk back to the observation tower behind it for a bird's-eye view of the entire Mojiko.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wAol04X1j8u7wmxHyzE0Dw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Kf4JiBvJTgP2Myd9eISkhA.jpeg)

After exiting the tower, I took a walk around Mojiko.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*0EvlQ9tL_CKmgXte8KHe9A.jpeg)

For lunch, I had the famous Mojiko curry yaki.
#### Kokura Castle

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GmRYm-lN6hvJK7YfEpiRNA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*X8-UceEKo95-ijfsIiZjpg.jpeg)

Mojiko to Kokura is very close, but Kokura is a small station. Upon exiting, it was quite desolate. I took a wrong turn looking for the entrance to Kokura and ended up walking a big circle. The entrance is actually on the side of the mall outside Kokura.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*28ZceWYL5Ow97LC2DFJqpg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*htqg9n9A0aO9pVKtt2fY4Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Q_mOgGt8Jx0AhTOozw9irQ.jpeg)

Kokura Castle is small, but there are many exhibits inside. The view from the main keep is quite ordinary (the front view is just the mall).

After visiting, I went back to the station to take the train back to Hakata. I obediently took the JR, but since it was a small station, I had to take a local train, which took over an hour to get back slowly.
#### Canal City Hakata

When I returned to Hakata, it was still early, so I went to Canal City Hakata and wandered around the city.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OH4UyxesQ_dSXGbNDv1v1A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*QeiwPfHkElqJuf9zb4klJA.jpeg)

I didn't check specifically and thought it was some kind of "castle" or "moat," but it turned out to be a department store XD. There really is a "moat" and even a water dance performance.

There are many places to shop here, including a Jump Shop.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*r1ZoKETxNEu7zFn_Wx1UKA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uucc02nUO6ED-eRZ5te7Bw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*TUlyy9j9SS1TgOU1LPilLg.jpeg)

It was still early, so I wandered around and went out to eat [Hakata Gion Tetsunabe Gyoza](https://www.google.com.tw/maps/place/%E5%8D%9A%E5%A4%9A+%E7%A5%87%E5%9C%92+%E9%90%B5%E9%8D%8B%E7%85%8E%E9%A4%83/@33.592549,130.3956236,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x354191c08e1f8ba5:0x2fab929d0965c092!8m2!3d33.5925325!4d130.4140561!16s%2Fg%2F11b6_mwx3l?entry=ttu){:target="_blank"}.

The skin was crispy, and there was juice inside, very delicious. Due to the language barrier, the waitress cutely gestured with a big belly for 2 servings (1 serving has only 8 pieces, 2 servings with 16 pieces are enough to be full). I didn't realize it at the time, so I only ordered one serving + the famous Hakata mentaiko.
#### Nakasu Yatai

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*dHDTL5F-aENFvtdjit2ANg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ho7cWp4ftznokbLjiAmINQ.jpeg)

After eating, it was still not dark, so I took a stroll to Nakasu Yatai.

It's still early, so I went to explore the department store \(Parco\) in Tenjin and then came back to see the night view after dark.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*JlcHaZzHUPY8bwqhRjO2Ug.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*yKaM_zDlN8D9O9gImt50VA.jpeg)

There is an Animate on the upper floor, and I got Satoru Gojo on my first capsule toy try.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Z8DS13esrRB4_qiXvF_cUQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*cxbTK3KovZ7DfV6H9WfpPA.jpeg)

The night view of Nakasu Yatai gives a lively atmosphere.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Xo1QFwS1gp50TYTqK2p_3A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GBUmAZZUxV-4UR5RMq64zg.jpeg)

Extravagant and eye-catching Japanese advertisement signs.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*M9--SjBUn9MMPqISM6T6sQ.png)

Nakasu Yatai is a roadside food stall on this side, bustling with people; they have ramen, oden, and barbecue, but nothing particularly attracted me, so I didn't go in to eat.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*f2ZJWpaaDzMJ6rqHGFDgVA.jpeg)

Went back to the hotel to drink, eat a late-night snack, and rest.
### Day 4 Sumiyoshi Shrine, Kushida Shrine, Tenjin Underground Shopping Street, Fukuoka Tower, Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks Baseball Game

A day of walking in Fukuoka, starting with a visit to the nearby Sumiyoshi Shrine after leaving the hotel.
#### Sumiyoshi Shrine

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*nbwbkzRIdaCmUVvHuNAMCA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wfWT4fMn18bOYXRvtZv2EA.jpeg)

It's small, and you probably wouldn't go out of your way to visit unless you're nearby.

Passed by Canal City Hakata again on the way to Kushida Shrine.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*0J4R0Uw9-EiJtlqEb_qDrg.jpeg)

Saw where the food stalls park in the morning, so small and cute.
#### Kushida Shrine

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*AKMxSha93q8rrBb1iCVSmw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GQUibdqPaaNc7VIxIUOoQQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8jot-WZdmwyeoSI04IOQng.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ueZwF6ubMD4QWKxJbeEj9w.jpeg)

Kushida Shrine is larger, and I drew a fortune slip that said my job search "will suddenly succeed," which gave me hope for work.

There is a display of the Hakata Gion Yamakasa float, which is huge and impressive.

Continued strolling around Fukuoka, and at noon, walked to [ハカタミヤチク \(Japan's No.1 Miyazaki Beef Specialty Store Hakata Miyachiku\)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FomFZet8BhoBpU4a7){:target="_blank"} to taste Miyazaki beef.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*jt_0agA4sSc_YjcqZUKonw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*6jTFPTwn331CA0vv1FHcEA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wc4yEWG8xEPPfRKXTa5gHg.jpeg)

This set of Miyazaki beef steak + beer costs about NT$650, delicious and cheap! The Miyazaki beef is juicy and has no strange taste.
#### Tenjin Underground Shopping Street

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*PJW3exeffBFjmRQyE4uj5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*EV5Pat2lj6ecjr0DTs-ytg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SYNvszV8kvn8rkVAfZWbGA.jpeg)

After lunch, I wandered around Tenjin, Tenjin Underground Shopping Street, and bought some souvenirs like chick cookies and cakes; also bought some popular muscat seedless grapes from the supermarket to try.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*KFwkPsRb4-rOVK3k0K23vQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CA1FUs6HspHBDkhCMzIONA.jpeg)

While wandering around Tenjin, I found a wild Kumamon manager.

Went back to the hotel to drop off the souvenirs and rest for a while before heading to Fukuoka Tower and the baseball game.
#### Fukuoka Tower

Took a bus from the city center to Fukuoka Tower.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*d23rmOQIrQA6lJIz9sDkkA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8eKqpGrWS9-edqYt0q_4BQ.jpeg)

Fukuoka Tower's full mirror design looks beautiful from the outside, I think it's even more beautiful than the Skytree!

\(Thanks to the passerby sister for taking the photo\)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*oyBb_rq_EhGlsrDfiSL0ig.jpeg)

But because the tower is built on the outermost side of the city near the sea, the view from the top is just so-so; not sure how the night view is.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*TXt1mbHYr5nu4d92k8N1lQ.jpeg)

After leaving Fukuoka Tower, we slowly walked to the previous station, which is Fukuoka PayPay Dome, and you can smell the sea.
#### Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks Baseball Game

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hGYr3ZLu47BGgMVMyHE_fw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BhAG_ZFPPs5U-vdGW9MQ4A.jpeg)

There were a lot of people \(about 70% full\), but there were still tickets available for purchase on-site.

**Ticket Buying Incident**

When buying tickets, I encountered an elderly man at the counter who got nervous and his hands were shaking when he saw a foreigner who couldn't speak the language; I got nervous too XD; in a moment of brain fog, I chose the last row in the middle of the front stand (with people sitting on both sides). It was super awkward going in, having to say "sumimasen" all the way in and out, and the seat was very small, squeezed between Japanese people. I couldn't speak a word of Japanese, it was very awkward... I sat upright and watched the entire game.

The ticket price was almost $1,500 NTD, in hindsight, I should have bought the cheapest lousy seat to watch comfortably by myself.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*jdIxN2c80rTtvueBGVv63A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*h17D9q0ifuOferUBpK2zyA.jpeg)

I have to say, the visual effects of the dome (very close to the field) and the large screen animations were all very good.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rtd4JAmPhxcUFEXQDcMK5w.jpeg)

The Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks' cheering tradition, in the 7th inning, everyone inflates balloons (using hand pumps) and then releases them. As for the trash... it doesn't matter, someone will clean it up later.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pU0cI1jbDXEc8olmBD8jHg.jpeg)

In the end, the home team won 4:2, more exciting than the CPBL, with pitchers throwing around 145km/h, and every inning had offense and defense, rarely three up three down; but the pace of the game was very fast, making it very enjoyable to watch.

However, in terms of cheerleading, Taiwan is still richer than Japan.

When the home team wins, fireworks are set off inside the dome, very cool!!

There were a lot of people leaving, but everyone kept a distance and walked slowly, so we followed the crowd all the way to the nearest subway station, Chinatown Station, because it seemed like the bus line would take a long time.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8gMp6Bl5FvxKpxk7B8B1Tg.jpeg)

Went back to the hotel to rest and tried the muscat seedless grapes bought in the afternoon, very sweet, a bit too sweet.
### Day 5 Kumamoto (Kumamoto Castle, Tsuruya Department Store)

Checked out early and walked around the pharmacy near the hotel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*IKO7DuRGXWppSx4kjEa-uw.png)

Found nothing much, had McDonald's (Egg McMuffin with iced Americano for only $107) and went back to get our luggage to take the JR to Kumamoto.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3VYUkk7Bn3aDiFzFiaqY9g.jpeg)

Finally saying goodbye to this hotel. The lobby has SoftBank Hawks dolls, and there's a 🇹🇼 flag outside, which is quite impressive because there's a Chinese-run convenience store next door with many Chinese people.

#### Fukuoka Hakata -> Kumamoto

Reserved seats using the station's electronic machines. Thought it was a bit far and had luggage, so decided to reserve a seat.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*m8MKMTpBRE_yI5ozboJG7g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sijQ_PWnzsDdmvtvw3jQvg.png)

Followed the instructions to reserve seats, basically:
1. Choose the language first, choose the language first, choose the language first (otherwise, you can't change it after inserting the ticket, you have to start over)
2. Insert the JR Pass ticket
3. Select departure and arrival stations (search using English station names)
4. Choose the train and seat
5. Done

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qR-5AlK9DCY6L15sB8tpKQ.jpeg)

If you have any questions, there are staff on-site to ask. Initially, there was a train departing in 15 minutes with no seats, so I had to buy a ticket for another train 45 minutes later.

But it was fine not to buy that train, as it takes about 10 minutes to walk from Hakata Station to the Shinkansen platform towards Kagoshima (via Kumamoto), which is a bit far and time was tight.

Used the JR Pass on the last day before it expired.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CAbsu55A7IG0XZ_hlcbHkg.jpeg)

> I was worried that my [27-inch suitcase](https://tw.eminent.com/?route=product/product&product_id=362&color=240&size=27){:target="_blank"} (about 69 x 50 x 29 cm) wouldn't fit on the luggage rack and that I would need to buy a [special oversized luggage seat, which is required if the total dimensions exceed 160 cm](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/tc/howto/baggage/){:target="_blank"}.

> A 27-inch suitcase would be too cramped at the feet and would also block the adjacent seat; it fits quite stably on the luggage rack, but you still have to lift it up. Buying a window seat means you might block the aisle when placing or retrieving luggage. Luckily, a kind Japanese gentleman offered to help me with my luggage.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ZBwOGq03fZYL6JesZlj2UA.jpeg)

Upon arriving in Kumamoto, I saw a giant Kumamon. First, I transferred to JR & subway to the hotel to drop off my luggage (Shiritsu Taiikukan-mae Station).

Kumamon is everywhere in Kumamoto...

#### Kumamoto Castle

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*jJ-spM14lTmb2ywUMFln6g.jpeg)

After dropping off my luggage at the hotel, I took the tram to Kumamoto Castle (to Tori-cho Suji Station).

You can first visit **Sakura-no-baba Josaien (forgot to take pictures)** to explore and recharge. You can buy Kumamoto Castle tickets here, where there are fewer people. If you buy tickets at the entrance of Kumamoto Castle, you might encounter large groups and long queues.

Ticket options: Kumamoto Castle 800 yen, Kumamoto Castle + the building behind the ticket counter (Historical and Cultural Experience Yuyuyuza) 850 yen, Kumamoto Castle + the building behind the ticket counter (Historical and Cultural Experience Yuyuyuza) + Kumamoto Museum 1,100 yen.

I bought the Kumamoto Castle + Yuyuyuza ticket, thinking it was only 50 yen more. After exploring, I found it average, but it did provide additional exhibits and earthquake-related artifacts inside Kumamoto Castle, suitable for photo opportunities.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Dibx_A0cDQxg60IpxfE24A.jpeg)

The main keep of Kumamoto Castle was restored and reopened in 2023, but other buildings are still under repair (you can see cranes).

The new design includes a skywalk, following the route all the way to Kumamoto Castle.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*QENksI3BlS-EcWClZ9F6fw.jpeg)

After reaching the main keep, you can see the skywalk you walked along.

Model of the situation after the earthquake.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CXnIAM3FUAvCOptLPMhfdg.jpeg)

The souvenir shop next to the square has a model of Kumamoto Castle, completing my collection of the three famous castles!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hmdXgqAiIlAoeX9rCdqNig.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*UCWV45ZU_7T94bkck15YzA.jpeg)

Returned to the ticket buying place and visited Yoyozu; inside there is a model of Kumamoto Castle and a Lego version of Kumamoto Castle, very cool.

Due to unfavorable weather, I didn't go further to the museum or Kato Shrine.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*fqonK-lhBpLPSqPLFCKXCw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Oef--KK1LHNMa03Dl0XOyQ.jpeg)

Walked back to the Tori-machi Suji Station, where there is the Kamitori Shopping Street and Kumamoto's local Tsuruya Department Store. The first floor of the east building of the department store is the newly renovated Kumamon Square (Kumamon's office).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*RuqRF-Cd6DIOUTxqrQ9YEw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*1E6yvVa1oKUmbSss7ZETag.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4ujIu_abHz71ELI9DhF-cw.jpeg)

While wandering around the shopping street, I happened to encounter a public event for Kumamon x Traffic Safety and got a Kumamon tote bag.

This whole area is not very interesting to walk around; it's quite boring. Only the Tsutaya Bookstore and MUJI building are worth visiting. Upon arriving in Kumamoto, you can immediately feel that there are many elderly people and few young people. The local Tsuruya Department Store is also mostly frequented by elderly people, selling mainly women's clothing and household items, with few things for young people.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*u5o4S5p6YpXD7GHqvoYP0A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rcNcYdUqN8Gtj2MzyLK-FA.jpeg)

Went to the Kumamon store in Tsuruya Department Store to buy some Kumamon merchandise (more variety than Kumamon Square), then went to the department store's underground street to buy alcohol and food (dinner + late-night snack) to eat back at the hotel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*xtIqYt_NrnPF4XSsBwKUFw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ZHqf7zyxC9AfOFlZDVozpQ.jpeg)

Kourou is a local Kumamoto sake recommended by the store, sweet and smooth to drink, but I think it lacks a strong rice flavor.
[Green Rich Hotel Suizenji 2023/09](https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F2y_kNs6patA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2y_kNs6patA&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube){:target="_blank"}

It's worth mentioning the hotel. Usually, I don't pay much attention to reviews; I just look for those with around 3 stars or more. This hotel's soundproofing was poor, and I encountered a whole floor of elementary school graduation trips, with doors constantly opening and closing loudly for two consecutive days, very disturbing.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4wmL-qX635TygnAySJSKVA.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*TTvU7fMU3mYwYBLrvtAVrA.jpeg)

Checked the detailed reviews on Google/Agoda and felt very much in agreement.

Poor soundproofing seems to be a common issue with old hotels, which I can tolerate (I bring my own earplugs). However, the hotel's WiFi, as previous reviews mentioned, is just for show.

The WiFi signal is available throughout the hotel, but even with full signal strength in the room, the speed is very slow, and web pages won't load. You have to stick close to the door for the internet speed to be normal, which is almost like having no internet at all.

> The price is also not attractive; it's better to stay in Fukuoka, where you can upgrade to APA for the same price.

> After this experience, I realized that even Japanese hotels need to be checked for reviews...

Really, apart from the convenient transportation to the airport, there are no advantages, and there are no convenience stores nearby (it takes more than 10 minutes to walk to one).
### Day 6 Suizenji Jojuen Garden, Kumamon Square Performance, Hanabata Square, Sakura Machi Shopping Center

Woke up in the morning and went straight to Suizenji Jojuen Garden across the street.
#### Suizenji Jojuen Garden (Izumi Shrine)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*33TFGLaZgl09Ym4MxYOo9w.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ADvpUiOgU8tAXE38m8zRmg.jpeg)

It feels a bit like Lin Family Mansion and Garden in Banqiao. The inside is very clean, the water is clear, and there are small Mount Fuji, Izumi Shrine, very fat koi fish, and cats.
#### Kumamon Square Performance

After walking around, took the tram to Suidocho to visit Kumamon Square (visited yesterday).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*pVjE3Ck2-qu15sDSM8nBjw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*2QFIar4JR7mnFKBM-la8FQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MUqMaZDdNgJUSPHEA9wCjw.jpeg)

Inside, there are photo opportunities with Kumamon Manager merchandise, and outside there is a monitor to see the inside situation.

Since it was still early for the 11 o'clock performance, went to the adjacent Tsuruya Department Store to find food.

The performance schedule can be referenced on the Kumamon [Square Official Website](https://www.kumamon-sq.jp/en/){:target="_blank"} (times are not fixed, but there are usually three performances on Saturdays).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*iq3M2rCOgZagsRsEWcJUZg.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ddvZEKnxHvBDrEbZciwwdA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wcYJIaNAefO0qhA7zne4Rg.jpeg)

Passed by the first floor of Tsuruya Department Store and found a sad Kumamon Manager playing the piano.

Went to B1 to eat the famous local Hachiraku Manju, which are thickly filled wheel cakes with white bean and red bean fillings. Those who like sweets will love it, and paired with coffee, it makes a breakfast.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*eLv_CbVF-poH9TEMZnCb9g.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ySR1j4uuvXNpXTu1u9vccQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CgUVnYiFpygQFoxwzDXOlA.png)

Around 11 o'clock, returned to Kumamon Square to wait for the performance. Now, there's no need for a lottery; just enter before the performance starts. If you are late, you can only watch the monitor outside. If you have children, you can sit inside.

Before the performance, they explain the rules, such as: do not hit Kumamon, do not raise your camera above your head (it will block those behind you), according to Japanese law, faces must be pixelated, and you are welcome to upload to SNS.

[![かモン！くまモン！【公式】](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/41a2_hqdefault.jpg "かモン！くまモン！【公式】")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vnhzcxl9E4){:target="_blank"}

The performance lasts about 30 minutes. The host sister speaks for Kumamon (all in Japanese). The process includes greeting everyone, talking about interesting things in Kumamoto, dancing (the song above, very catchy), and saying hi to people from different countries (there were many Taiwanese this time XD).

Kumamon is very cute, with big and interesting movements.

The merchandise sold inside the square is actually less and more expensive, so didn't buy anything here.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*xqrEu23KmZWe2Wxj1NKmDQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Uo6TxwThhcs5gWRWDABhlg.jpeg)

After watching the performance, it was close to noon. Walked down the shopping street to eat at [Katsuretsutei Shinshigai Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LFjoSMqAAKokpQ7x7){:target="_blank"}; walked outside the shopping street, and it instantly upgraded from child-friendly to restricted, with a whole row of free information centers (the other side of Kumamoto Ginza Street is the same).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*K6Sb1VRksFKX78EB8_qQvA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*v3n0_6uoHthkXdpNZPVbbA.jpeg)

Super thick juicy pork chop rice, what's special is that they provide their sauerkraut (shared, self-serve, remember to use the red chopsticks). Other than that, it's the same as eating Japanese pork chops in Taiwan, they will give you a grinding stick and sesame seeds to grind the sauce; rice, tea, soup, and cabbage are all free to refill; I ate two bowls of white rice in one go, very satisfying.
#### Hanabatake Square

After eating and drinking, continue walking down the shopping street towards Hanabatake Square.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*xxyLvJbgFbTwyvbEE-03SQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*vMfcfDDw4UeF6GlWSMEidA.jpeg)

Happened to encounter an event at the square on Saturday, Food Summit 2003, selling food all around, with a stage in the middle for a wrestling performance.

Bought a cup of sparkling wine + grilled sausage and sat down to watch the performance. The grilled sausage was not fragrant and not as tasty as in Taiwan.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*aB7AGxcyyOk0Bux_kGOE_Q.png)

Halfway through eating, they even fought into the audience, a bit scary but very immersive; later it got too hot, so after finishing, we left and went to the Sakura-machi Shopping Center to browse the department store.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4JL4q8VJD8hjRD9V_1yUgA.jpeg)

Hanabatake Square, it feels like there are events every Saturday and Sunday, you can check before coming, next week is the Taiwan Festival!
#### Sakura-machi Shopping Center

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*gYwyLO5uIgukaUxrw9EWBQ.png)

There is a Kumamon waving on the rooftop, and on the second floor, there are Kumamon merchandise (**I think it's the most complete**).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*yAOzzYJuklbuOaCK9OgI5A.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*94zbX1WOg_wTjPbrMi8RtA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BQB_zX8VTVHeLKvCcu0KLg.jpeg)

There are also Kumamon performances here, check the announcement times.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*yWAytCqQ3_ROLqw3IsAkrQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Gbk2sDFc-9AnY8Y8M8KK9w.jpeg)

You can go all the way up to the rooftop from the outside stairs to find the waving Kumamon statue. This building is also the Kumamoto Bus Center, where you can buy tickets on the second floor to go to other cities.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*gwNyu3zqlk0h31lxWozjKQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*W7AY5P9VIsMM-zxUVlUULQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hfbAEx1qw6Ly8tnvOudLOw.jpeg)

There is a large garden on the rooftop, with a pool where you can play with water, great for kids.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*f-f2HnZHXygams-VMOK_rA.jpeg)

You can also take the escalator up from inside, starting from the third floor's Shabushabu restaurant (this Shabushabu restaurant is completely empty) to find the escalator going up.

> Personally, I think Sakura-machi Shopping Center is newer and better to browse than Tsuruya Department Store.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Lu1xQ63cuGzDv-yXjr47oA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BAl-4v-Cpbgmub9ZtuTuMg.jpeg)

Next to the Sakura-machi Shopping Center is the Kumamoto Prefecture Product Center, which not only has specialties from Kumamoto Prefecture but also some Kumamon merchandise (for example: Kumamon incense burner XD).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*2I1wloHndXebjUNrnhTjEQ.jpeg)

On the way back, walked through the Kamitori and Shimotori shopping streets again.

Went to Muji to buy clothes and miscellaneous items, and Matsumoto Kiyoshi to replenish cosmetics (for some reason, my Visa card never works at Matsumoto Kiyoshi, it happened before in Tokyo, and the same in Kumamoto this time, had to use Japanese yen cash).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*FK2sNHmqd3-ufsVI7ZzT9Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*E9E3KciyDwIAylT1-ERKww.jpeg)

Arrived at the hotel near evening, solved dinner casually at Lawson on the way, and went to bed early to prepare for tomorrow's trip to Aso Volcano!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*b_HHO4jd4I82Slb8m9gYig.jpeg)

Originally saw a trip to Aso Volcano on KKDay/Klook, including one lunch, no guide, no chartered car; without transportation included, it didn't seem meaningful, so didn't book it (luckily didn't book, it really wasn't meaningful).

Instead, there are chartered trips from Fukuoka to Aso, which are more convenient.
### Day 7 Aso Volcano, Kusasenri, Aso Shrine, Kumamoto Station AMU PLAZA KUMAMOTO

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*g8DO6u8haU1XQz4VkRjweQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*JHWBoBcnp4VM77ZBgAYcLA.jpeg)

Early in the morning, I walked to the bus stop to take the bus to Aso Station; while waiting for the bus, I encountered Kumamon.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*YCvups0vgkaCMqbEcKk34A.jpeg)

The bus will first pass by Aso Airport (coming here the day after tomorrow Orz).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*NycqqQF1Ak7bPtZcEypm-w.jpeg)

One special thing along the way is that when entering the Aso Volcano area, the bus will introduce Aso Volcano and then play local mountain songs, asking you to imagine walking on the Aso Volcano grassland.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hlWP0nXAknwCFs66N-ltUQ.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*xxkMLT2jNg_N1Uycul8Fcw.jpeg)

Arriving at Aso Station, there is a [One Piece Usopp](https://www.nipponsensor.net/hotspots/kyushu/kumamoto/16623/){:target="_blank"} statue outside the station for photos (I forgot).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*_J_3xNKZm7vkIC0hsiLRdg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*7WAH9YmsQfH5slj9eE1_1A.png)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BxUFCyUirWnwBccSHrlQ4w.png)

You can buy an Aso Volcano one-day pass from the vending machine here (saving a few hundred yen) and get a timetable. The one-day pass is only valid for three stops on the timetable, and you need to draw a ticket when boarding; it seems unusable at other stops.

I will take route 8, the bus going up the mountain at 10:45.

**Travel time up the mountain: about 40 minutes.**

There aren't many people, so just line up a bit when the time is near, and everyone gets on; but probably for safety considerations on the mountain road, there are no standing places; those who get carsick might need to take motion sickness medicine.

Aso also has a helicopter experience tour, where you can directly see the volcano by helicopter. Interested people can check it out.
#### Aso Volcano

![Kami\-komezuka](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rLrgMZZxclLg8e8ivamkgA.jpeg)

Kami\-komezuka

On the way up the mountain, you will first pass by Kusasenri and then reach the mountain top station. From the mountain top station, you need to change buses once more for about 10 minutes to reach the volcano crater.

I happened to meet a TSMC colleague next door who was also traveling alone (here on a business trip XD), and it was both our first time in Aso, so we teamed up to explore.

At the mountain top station, we had to change buses again, but we were too lazy to queue for the bus, so we chose to walk up the mountain (about 15–20 minutes).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*5Qd1tO_U2_1dNP8a8g8kKg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sPibzt-cJqGdsHESJDlFHQ.jpeg)

Walking to the mountain square, you come out to the fourth crater of Aso Nakadake.

Having a travel companion makes taking photos no problem!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*wQMQKIQYQdgx7Ee4ZdFeXQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3wzJTugnp4oLBLQX6FYQng.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ZWzO9QxTavrWzY0a-VKVPA.jpeg)

It's very cool on the mountain, not hot at all, filled with the smell of sulfur. If you have the condition shown in the third picture, consider your health.

Just a quick look around, didn't walk to the Aso Nakadake crater, just came up to take a look and then went down the mountain.

**Little Episode**

We were chatting so happily on the way down that we didn't pay attention to the bus direction. When the bus was about to depart, we hurriedly got on and ended up being taken back up, so we had to walk down again XD

After arriving at the mountain top station, this time we clearly saw the route 8 bus, route 8 bus, route 8 bus, going down to Aso Station; got off at Kusasenri.
#### Kusasenri

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*YAiporN5fEeP6kvfHtIeMA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*zlo-HL77zL6a8qqAAxxL4A.jpeg)

Ate the famous おか牛丼飯, there were many people but also many seats, the food came out quickly, almost no waiting.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*yO0t_Sc_4KFwzWlkc_0cBg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*evCQPMnTNh36KfxYt5df6g.jpeg)

After eating, go out and stroll around Kusasenri (it has a bit of the feel of Qingtian Gang), there are horseback riding activities.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*L88s9FmIbWQf5X2uXnfeRw.jpeg)

After eating, take the same No. 8 bus back to Aso Station, retracing the route down the mountain.
#### Aso Shrine

When we arrived at Aso Station, the JR train to Aso Shrine (Miyaji Station) was departing in three minutes. If we missed it, we would have to wait another hour. We ran into the station and encountered **Aso is a small station without electronic payment**, so we had to buy tickets in a hurry at the vending machine before boarding the train.

> Aso Station has only one platform, so just board the train without thinking too much. Later, we found out that if you really don't have time to buy a ticket, you can board first and pay when you exit.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*F5ILZAsRZmIAkBtQrOsS7A.jpeg)

After getting off at Miyaji Station, it takes about a 20-minute walk to reach Aso Shrine (just walk straight, but it's a bit far).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*psZQ7-HaTvmpRtLZWdpjMw.jpeg)

On the way, we encountered a wild Kumamon.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Wei6wFhutK5dLcBw8uNo0Q.jpeg)

The shrine is not big, and we finished our visit quickly. Part of the shrine was also under renovation.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*r4pVzDUZAgSM1GqncJFtZg.jpeg)

After leaving, there is a small Omotesando shopping street next to it where you can buy some food and take a break.

> Thanks to the gentleman who treated us to fried beef and potato cakes.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*__dthm4EZrm3m0lKXj6Ong.jpeg)

After finishing our visit, we started to walk back slowly. We originally planned to take the 15:47 JR train back to Kumamoto, but when we got back to Miyaji Station, we found out that the train was fully reserved and had no unreserved seats available, so we couldn't board.

Here is the timetable, or please check it in advance; otherwise, you will end up like us, having to wait an hour for the next train at 16:35 to return to Kumamoto.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*hC6lSvcNnCGWUbCsIZ-b0Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qXuDCbBIT4n1gdil7k1WjQ.jpeg)

With plenty of time left, we walked back to the Matsumoto Kiyoshi store on the way (it's actually quite far, about a 10-minute walk).

Finally, a last look at the peaceful Aso.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*5DGvGVjiPKZ2E5Tsk5DdvA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Z9af42-__2b8xd0_hp7ptQ.jpeg)

The local train slowly made its way back to Kumamoto, taking about 1 hour and 45 minutes.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Iv-OdLjZKnqXAIo4COMzFg.png)

There is a section of the route that is zigzagged, and the train will reverse. Don't worry, you didn't get on the wrong train!
### Kumamoto Station AMU PLAZA KUMAMOTO

Back at Kumamoto Station, we said goodbye to the gentleman, hoping to meet again someday.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*BXcGaSrX2Vk5OwZzRA4Hng.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*lIgHruNpguQ0-xbGbMvjlA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*F7xqsHEKz8B8ndTSjwhdag.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*-6LgKo-WB_drTE4ZeAHE7Q.jpeg)

At Kumamoto Station, we visited the newly opened AMU PLAZA KUMAMOTO department store (larger and more diverse than the Sakura Machi shopping center) and the nearby Higo Market (selling food).

We found many Kumamon again XD.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*4e0sLEIgYSQQMLDEQARecQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*x1fFUVJDyQHNfERM5y2VBA.png)

After having dinner at the food court (Miyazaki chicken, average), I walked around the entire building, bought some snacks, and Kumamoto-produced strawberry wine (tasted good, planning to bring it back to Taiwan) before returning to the hotel.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*o2wvUot9Lx8hGWPiXVfDwg.jpeg)

There is a rather special store called "BIWAN 美灣" that sells Taiwanese food (I saw Guai Guai XD). After some research, I found out it is [opened by Yuan Soap from Taiwan](https://spice.kumanichi.com/outing/spices-iine/126872/){:target="_blank"}.

![[https://kumataiwanlife\.com/](https://kumataiwanlife.com/){:target="_blank"}](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*R6fA_H3d9LiQrlsF0qe17g.png)

[https://kumataiwanlife\.com/](https://kumataiwanlife.com/){:target="_blank"}

While researching, I found a cool website — [https://kumataiwanlife\.com/](https://kumataiwanlife.com/){:target="_blank"} which has the latest news, events, and trivia about Kumamoto in Chinese (for example: [Kumamoto's "Band-Aid" is called "LIBATAPE"](https://kumataiwanlife.com/?p=1350){:target="_blank"} … etc.)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*WqIU1mYT_2Dw45oqz0RLQA.jpeg)

Today I discovered that the hotel's vending machine actually sells canned raw cola, which I couldn't find in the three major convenience stores.

> It is a collaboration between Suntory and Pepsi, not available in Taiwan. Made using the method for draft beer, it has a strong carbonation and is not too syrupy. I usually find regular cola too sweet to finish, but I can drink all of the raw cola!

After a satisfying meal, I went to bed early, preparing for the last day in Kumamoto (excluding the return flight day).

### Day 9 Wandering and Shopping in Kumamoto

By the third day in Kumamoto, it was actually quite boring. I had already visited all the attractions, so I just tried to find some places to see and buy some souvenirs and cosmetics.

Originally planned to go to Shimabara City, but it was too far (one way 2 hours 45 minutes), and the JR Pass had already expired, so I would have to spend money on long-distance tickets, so I gave up. Oita and Yufuin were also too far, so I gave up. I was too lazy to go to Minami Aso Village, leaving it for next time. So I just wandered around the city and shopped, walking slowly.

#### Kumamoto Inari Shrine

Early in the morning, I went to the Torichosuji area, first visiting the Kumamoto Inari Shrine that I missed on the first day.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*dSW4qex51azlo7Xybd1ujA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qNJWdj8FW6rZhrpzttACLQ.jpeg)

#### Kato Shrine

Walked all the way to the back to Kato Shrine (quite far, about a 20-minute walk with slopes).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*aox_Wt82SKDfLMar5WOH_Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*JD_NBBMeWKnXiBJSni29lQ.jpeg)

Seeing this slope, turn up and you will reach Kato Shrine. You can also see the area under repair from the first day at the main keep, with many scattered castle walls to be restored one by one.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*U1VyNqimZOYqPhcFZiVW3g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*juF2OXyLTOY8FSQKmwLJSg.jpeg)

It's small, and half of it is still under repair.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*CPy6z2mg4vKSisM50WThog.jpeg)

There is a small Kumamoto earthquake donation box. I didn't worship at Kato Shrine, instead, I donated to the box.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*bwmOm2Dldn0rLhK6e5Ge5Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*1tkOVIao3N5NYMVp7uvF3w.jpeg)

From here, you can see Kumamoto Castle from the back.

After returning the same way, I headed to Kumamoto City Hall (there is a free observation deck on the 14th floor). The walk to Kato Shrine is quite far, so you can take a bus.

> Originally planned to go to Kumamoto Art Museum, Handicraft Museum, etc., but they were all closed on Monday!

#### Kumamoto City Hall

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qrtQr_KXzAgXo967gp0JHA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*OnrBESIrnhQYIWfrVW8y1g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*aqWQ5EBLd8FTytxxHlzUSw.jpeg)

Kumamoto City Hall 14th floor offers a panoramic view of the entire Kumamoto city and Kumamoto Castle.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*kIj1wa9QZAnOMOyNXCRdpA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uOuhkn9mSezuH5BkagqkiA.jpeg)

After leaving the city hall and heading towards the Sakura-machi shopping center, you will pass a pedestrian bridge, which is a great spot for taking photos of the Kumamoto tram.

This intersection is Kumamoto Ginza Street, which I mentioned a few days ago as being full of free information centers.
#### Sakura-machi Shopping Center

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*SqQLdgnwXOP0Ng1hvryt2w.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*00xi36Pcc5QEZVvssH-gBQ.jpeg)

Went back to Sakura-machi shopping center for some shopping and had Miyazaki beef with Kumamoto beer again; bought a Kumamon Daifuku as a souvenir to take back to Taiwan (so cute).
#### Don Quijote

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*qpqkxJ3ATYSe8O-FPmqUzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*IYVcoKjrHAi7z4n4Tj1iXQ.jpeg)

Walked from Shimotori to Kamitori and back to Tori-machi Suji, stopping by Don Quijote for some shopping (the tax-free counter is on the second floor).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Ve5ggActk-7TuO0d5HmDMg.jpeg)

After shopping, decided to go back to the hotel to rest and drop off the stuff.

**Little Episode**
Took the tram and met a cute elderly couple from Kumamoto; they pointed at the transparent bag of tax-free Nissin instant noodles and said "Sugoi ne~", I replied "Good! Good!"; then I took out the Kumamon Daifuku I just bought and said to the grandma "Kawaii ne~", she gave a thumbs up and said "Kawaii, arigatou"; then I said "Watashi wa Taiwanjin desu" and the grandma seemed to greet me with something (my Japanese is too poor to understand, only caught the word "genki"), I responded politely, and when getting off, I said goodbye to the elderly couple.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rSVRHXrWwE_7MVIQ5zPfBw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*5LeSnaUI3dYrl7LOuhZUcQ.jpeg)

After returning to the hotel, I opened the curtains for the first time and saw the Suizenji area behind; the view was actually nice, and you could hear the insects chirping at night.

After a short rest, there wasn't much to do in the afternoon, so I just randomly picked a spot on the map to wander around.
#### Luffy Statue

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*9HwmY-q4RDpI_mukfBEHZg.jpeg)

First walked to the front of the Kumamoto Prefectural Office to find the Luffy statue.
#### Kengun Shrine

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*HDnNjb2OR4op4UHJ35070g.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*I1Um2ql5cFqYYhHtOoccyg.jpeg)

Then took a bus and walked to Kengun Shrine; a small shrine, almost no one was there as it was about to close.

There is no direct bus to this place, you have to walk a short distance (about 15 minutes); after leaving the shrine, continued walking towards "Kumamoto Zoo" (about 20-30 minutes) to find the Chopper statue.
#### Chopper Statue

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*b7Qb_Ja8AiHi9SwqXCUwFA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MLb6P17ri2J0R62G7x4d9g.jpeg)

Saw a Sergeant Frog manhole cover on the way (seems to be from a previous event).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*df7Ps_wc5TAgu0SkP6osXQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*MmoKL92AZmjzzpsPJyj5CA.jpeg)

Found the Chopper statue at the entrance of the zoo.

> Kumamoto Zoo seemed quite boring from what I researched earlier, so I didn't plan to go in; it was also closed by the time I arrived in the evening.

**Little Episode**
Met a Taiwanese family at the zoo entrance who wanted to take a photo, so I helped them; the next day at the airport, I ran into them again and helped them take another photo with the plane, the little brother called me the "photo-taking brother" XD.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*y5ZsykQBnmg6b7N3DeWZxg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*JTgYazu_Z5maJJLiqY2QJw.jpeg)

Checked the map and saw that Ezu Lake Park in the Suizenji area was nearby, so I walked there; found out it was just a local riverside park for exercise, so I took the bus back to the hotel (it was the bus starting point).

#### [Ashiyoshi Ramen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vNGgQPncUcK3izfA6){:target="_blank"}

Went to an izakaya near Shin-Suizenji Station for dinner.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*AhV4X5pWE9ri8Nbo4ceMIA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*V10ShLfXQNdMi_F5Svz0ng.jpeg)

with former colleague (Digital Technology, later appeared on the Line News cover for Books.com, a.k.a. Books.com Goddess [Irene Yu](https://medium.com/u/bc7cf3484e00){:target="_blank"}) for a meal.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sPQNI7cSOi_c9VzHJXoHag.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*tqrseI_XNo2_lAEsoYB1hg.jpeg)

It was so touching to have a meal with a familiar person in a foreign place, especially since I had been isolated for several days (not understanding Japanese, hardly speaking). In the end, I even received a Beppu souvenir 😭.

Ate too quickly, only remember the chicken wings were delicious, also tried horse meat skewers (Kumamoto horse meat sashimi is famous, but I didn't dare to eat it); the hostess was very kind, but the menu was all in Japanese, and the font was hard to recognize with translation software, so I could only guess XD.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ie9QWFPOfofh0IcwBYD7ww.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*7t6NYSMX5_tvRX2cb6XwJA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*zLHbPQse_maMlUzGYyuMoA.jpeg)

After dinner, I walked back to the hotel (about 15 minutes), finally strolling through the streets of Kumamoto, went to Lawson and FamilyMart to buy ice cream and amazake (originally thought it was sake, but [amazake is not alcohol, it's a nourishing summer drink](https://www.thecan.com.tw/tw/article/detail/1646){:target="_blank"}).

Also bought breakfast for the next morning (melon bread + juice). FamilyMart's fruit juice (melon, strawberry...) is really delicious. I almost always buy it when I see it, the fruit pieces inside are sweet and tasty.

### Day 10 Return Trip

I've been wandering alone in Japan for 10 days, starting to miss home, miss Taiwanese food, and friends in Taiwan.

The only advantage of this hotel is that there is an airport shuttle bus right across the street.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*Q3I5e7mD3ek_Cnl2LdhQiw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*GYnDXmStxszFGUoi54CLrw.jpeg)

Encountered an actual delay again, Google Map showed it had passed; fortunately, with the lesson from Nagasaki and the electronic signboard, I continued to wait patiently. The bus finally arrived after almost a 10-minute delay.

The driver helps to put the suitcase in the luggage area under the bus, just remember to take it when getting off.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*uSC1NPoJtQtXzdBLiOeRNw.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*9db3P4To6dwJg0sOAnrHuA.jpeg)

On the way, I encountered wild Kumamon fences XD. Kumamoto really has Kumamon everywhere!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*2dDzo0Y2tjdNBhVMakvjpA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*1CePzjcS-yUr-zB8ceFRkQ.jpeg)

Arrived at the airport early around 9 o'clock (since there was nowhere else I wanted to go, coming later would just mean staying at the hotel longer).

Aso Kumamoto Airport (KMJ) is very new and small, with not many flights; only three international flights today, and only three counters for international flights, all used in rotation.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*fDnBvPoq3ykeKOSNwskGwQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*DgcVHY4YocMy9-EBghL_VA.jpeg)

Waited until about 10:20 for check-in/boarding to open. Previously always flew with EVA Air (allowed two carry-ons), this time flying with China Airlines and found out it's one carry-on, quickly compressed into one on the spot.

The ground staff said not to leave after checking in, wait around for about 5 ~ 10 minutes. If there are any issues with the luggage, they will call the number to handle it (the airport is too small, no electronic signboard, just have to wait).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*dNkC6XSNAjs4gDV64iJV7w.jpeg)

After confirming no issues, headed towards the international departure direction; originally thought of arriving early to explore the airport, but there wasn't much.

> At that time, I was probably really tired, later found out there is actually an observation deck to watch planes. After checking in the luggage, you can actually go explore, no need to rush to depart.

> **Note that all the food on the 3rd floor is "after security check" before departure. You can turn left to the food area, but have to go through security again to return; once you complete departure, there is no food for sale, only duty-free shops.**

Almost no one all the way to departure inspection, security check was also enjoyed alone.

Since I wasn't very hungry, I didn't go to the food area, directly departed to the international departure lounge.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*_oj5R6kKSwDsI_aOB449YA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*aahQDP3h76_zc7Yk61RtGg.jpeg)

The waiting room and duty-free shop are not big, but they are very new and have USB charging sockets; you can see the observation deck mentioned earlier from here (those people on the 2nd floor).

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*LV9iP-MOPlrctBhUTB6OZQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*ycJw8pExkdUEpA5_5RBXHw.jpeg)

Didn't buy anything special, just spent the remaining balance of Suica on my Apple Watch and bought two bottles of peach water to drink back in Taiwan.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*8MT4XnUcenSdDrE7_It_XA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*K_cVUSwpspe9re4qHkudkA.jpeg)

12:30 took off on time, Bye Kyushu, Bye Kumamoto.

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*3f9tZ0UjeDdlh3Ah5fcsAA.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*rJhLcKT_r3VVYWaj8YOnVg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*A1pAJb6FzQhCSmfpUBJOsg.jpeg)

The return flight was newer, and there was a Super Mario Bros movie, which I finished just as we arrived in Taiwan; the seats weren't fully occupied, so I got to enjoy a whole row to myself!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*-1ckVteQdVGh3ZA-Hvz_zQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*PPUY8Oc3HftS7ZA_Mo2GDw.jpeg)

When getting off the plane, I noticed the person in front of me had a helmet. Did they come by motorcycle to catch the flight? 🤣

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*1SvOT6mKYra467fjBumyjg.jpeg)

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*sIPn8bhEYvbJq4HDS_cEdQ.jpeg)

Arrived at Taoyuan Airport, heading home!

When picking up my luggage, it might have been checked in too early; it took a while to arrive, so I experimented with the Airtag finding feature, and it beeped when the luggage was close!

![](/assets/d78e0b15a08a/1*RBHalFi8RGlP8JiTQm-LvA.jpeg)

Back in Taiwan, I saw Kumamon again on the road XD (seems to be a new card promotion by E.SUN Bank).

#### **Additional Notes on Japanese Buses and Trams Experience**
- Ticket (with a number) = There will be a small machine at the door when you get on the bus to draw a ticket (similar to drawing a number ticket).
- Some routes have a flat fare and may not have tickets.
- If using electronic payment (Suica), you don't need to draw a ticket, but be careful not to let the balance go negative (**different from Taiwan**).
- Buses and trams do not give change, but you can exchange money at the coin machine on the bus (also at the driver's money slot).
- Mostly board from the back and get off from the front.
- Japanese buses wait for people to sit down before starting and wait for people to get off before opening the door; so you can stand up when the bus stops, no need to crowd to the front before it stops (**different from Taiwan**).
- When getting off, look at the ticket number and pay the corresponding fare:
