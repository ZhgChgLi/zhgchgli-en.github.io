As a clumsy person with OCD, using a delicate product like the Apple Watch is very troublesome; due to my clumsiness, it's easy to accidentally bump it, and with OCD, any scratches make me very uncomfortable. So, I immediately applied a full-coverage screen protector to prevent accidents.

But actually, **just applying a full-coverage screen protector is not enough. The watch itself is curved, and the edges of the protector are fragile, easily chipping if the frame is accidentally rubbed**:

![Full-coverage screen protector chipping without a case](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*Pqap-5lrHUEWBonbKHXrAA.jpeg)

Full-coverage screen protector chipping without a case

I am already on my third full-coverage screen protector; although the watch screen itself is undamaged, it still hurts. Perfect fit + no impact on touch + thin + high transparency + no edge lifting = very expensive ($990/piece). The money spent on protectors is almost enough to upgrade to the stainless steel version. Therefore, the Apple Watch case is very important to me, as it enhances the protection of the frame and reduces the risk of damage from bumps.

This article will unbox two Apple Watch cases and compare their experiences, functionality, appearance, and suitable scenarios. Let's get started!

### Catalyst Apple Watch Ultra-Thin Waterproof Case (with strap)

This case features an integrated design with a strap, providing comprehensive protection from wear to impact and water resistance.

![Fixed Ring Buckle](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*epVVh0SvkWw_KUN9vZ2EfQ.jpeg)

Fixed Ring Buckle

The length is similar to the original sport band (L) but with denser holes, allowing for a more adjustable fit to the wrist size; the fixed ring has a buckle to ensure it does not fall off during intense exercise.
#### Installation:

We need to disassemble the Catalyst case first, then place the Apple Watch body inside and reassemble it.
1. First, unscrew the back screws

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*W-gLZXVO1yJNgXJlNJZmGA.jpeg)

2. After removing the screws, hold the strap with both hands and use your thumbs to push the case body outwards.

3. Disassemble all parts

5. Place the Apple Watch body into the waterproof case

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*I_QwQJ6ywR5R6TN8FRSByA.jpeg)

When installing, make sure the waterproof case is properly fitted without wrinkles to avoid affecting waterproof performance.

6. Put on the protective case top cover

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*DZiQG08CWoAhg7norvU8lw.jpeg)

Similarly, ensure there are no wrinkles to avoid affecting waterproof performance.

7. Reattach the strap body and screw it back

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*-8sAoAOg2tu_gzabuZvRww.jpeg)

Snap back the body and screw it back ( **Please do not over-tighten the screws!** )
#### Testing:
1. Charging can be directly attached:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*COoQIHhRpUYWl8bdbAGTBw.png)

Test result: No problem, does not affect charging speed.

2. Heart Rate:

3. Display:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*RFRpBr_IkJDA4Y6ryx7W_g.jpeg)

Apple Watch 4 full-screen display is unobstructed, no problem ✅

4. Digital Crown

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*B9md7k4pmOkgL8LuS1V8Ww.jpeg)

Can be used normally ✅

5. Sound Reception Impact:

No significant differences ✅

6. Appearance:

Due to my large hands, I originally bought the largest 44mm version of the watch. After adding the protective case, it looks even more rugged and grand.

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*ibQF9d8Z-bJhsJY4wo9H0Q.jpeg)

#### Thoughts:

This watch strap truly provides 360° comprehensive protection and enhances its waterproof function to adapt to more challenging environments.

The strap is made of skin-friendly material, making it feel no different from the original sports strap. However, the adjustment part of the strap has denser holes, allowing for a more suitable size (the original strap either felt too loose or too tight for me). The buckle on the fixing ring also gives me more peace of mind as someone with OCD!

The overall appearance is wild and rugged, making it perfect for outdoor activities, hiking, rock climbing, and diving. These are also the scenarios where this strap can provide the maximum protective effect!

### Muvit Apple Watch Protective Case

The second product I tried is the Muvit Apple Watch Protective Case. Compared to the professional protection of Catalyst, this one is simpler and more convenient, suitable for various daily life scenarios. Despite this, Muvit still passed the U.S. military standard MIL-STD 810G 3-meter drop test, ensuring safety and protection!
#### Unboxing and Usage:

![Front of the box](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*-i3rLhQgb4DjbICi123_OA.jpeg)

Front of the box

Two different color protective cases: Left - Black / Right - Light Purple

#### Testing:

Digital Crown:

![](/assets/a66ce3dc8bb9/1*YAzNl8KPlYdkhWVThowL2Q.jpeg)

Works normally ✅. Other functions like audio, heart rate, display, etc., are not affected as this is just a frame protective case, so no special tests are needed!
#### Thoughts:

The most satisfying aspect of using this protective case is that I can quickly and conveniently switch straps according to different life scenarios (leather strap for suits, sports strap for daily use). It's easy to install and remove, and its protection is sufficient for all daily scenarios (housework, cleaning, moving things). Currently, I use this protective case for my daily life.

### Summary:

It has been over 4 months from receiving the trial to writing this article. During this period, I moved houses (Sorry... the scenes in this article are messy), participated in a duathlon (10KM running + 40KM cycling), and went diving in Malaysia. These two protective cases have accompanied me through various activities, and the full-coverage screen protector is still perfect!

Remember how many screen protectors I changed? The answer is 3 in 3 months, averaging less than a month before they somehow got damaged and chipped. Each one costs $990 Orz

> I can only say it's a regret meeting late. If I had known about protective cases earlier, I wouldn't have wasted so much money!

Both Catalyst and Muvit have solved my problem of constantly chipping screen protectors. If you don't use a screen protector, you should definitely get a protective case to protect the screen edges; otherwise, a cracked screen will hurt even more.

For recommendations, if you often engage in intense sports (rock climbing, diving) or labor work, I suggest choosing Catalyst for better peace of mind. If you're just an office worker, occasionally run, and like to change watch bands according to your mood, then Muvit is sufficient!

### Chat:

From [the first complete unboxing](../a2920e33e73e/) to [three months of use](../e85d77b05061/), it's been almost a year since I've been wearing my Apple Watch S4. There haven't been many changes in usage; third-party apps are still scarce, and the most frequently used features are still Apple Pay, unlocking the Mac, and checking notifications. The Apple Watch has integrated into my daily life, and I've gotten used to its convenience.

> _By the way, let's look forward to Watch OS 6 together :)_

In the past six months, I've been more diligent in utilizing the Apple Watch's fitness features, recording running and cycling times, routes, and heart rates. Besides recording, the awards make exercising more goal-oriented and fulfilling. Competing with friends or sharing results on social media makes exercising fun and easier to maintain!
