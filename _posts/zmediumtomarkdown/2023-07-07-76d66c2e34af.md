### [Travelogue] 2023 Kansai 8-Day Free and Easy Trip

Record of an 8-day free and easy trip to Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe in May 2023, including information on food, accommodation, and transportation.

#### Preface

Previously, I have only been to two Southeast Asian countries, Sabah 🇲🇾 in 2019 and Bangkok 🇹🇭 in 2018, both on group tours.

![I really like the boundless blue sky and unrestrained freedom in Southeast Asia](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*TPZ1M70G3KF3662-TH_ehA.jpeg)

I really like the boundless blue sky and unrestrained freedom in Southeast Asia.

#### ENFP

As an enthusiastic and impulsive ENFP who acts on a whim, the time between the proposal and departure of this trip was only two weeks. It all started when my friend [Huang Xinping](https://medium.com/u/eac9088ed800){:target="_blank"} happened to have a career gap, and he, an INFJ complementing my ENFP personality, provided detailed planning while I offered enthusiastic direction. With this perfect harmony, we decided to embark on this journey on a whim.

### KKday Promotion
- One-stop purchase for experiences and tickets in the Kyoto area: "[**Kansai Airport KIX Airport Express Train Ticket (Hello Kitty), Amanohashidate Day Tour, JR Pass Kansai Area Pass, Arashiyama-Sagano Scenic Railway Ticket, Kyoto Tower, Kimono Rental, Professional Photography, eSim/Sim Card, Rickshaw, Kinkakuji Temple and Kiyomizu Temple Day Tour**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/city/kyoto?cid=19365&ud1=76d66c2e34af){:target="_blank"}"
- One-stop purchase for experiences and tickets in the Osaka area: "[**Osaka Castle, Universal Studios Japan, Fast Track Entry, Osaka Area Pass, Kaiseki Cuisine, Shinsaibashi, Byodoin Temple Day Tour**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/city/osaka?cid=19365&ud1=76d66c2e34af){:target="_blank"}"

### Pre-trip Preparation
#### Leisure

Since everything was quite spontaneous, and we only planned to visit Universal Studios Osaka, we bought tickets online. However, due to the proximity to the travel date, all special tickets were sold out, and we had to settle for regular entry tickets.

> For popular attractions and theme parks in Japan, it's really necessary to buy tickets in advance Orz. This time, we missed out on baseball tickets, and there were no tickets available on-site, so we could only do a day tour of the venue.

For other attractions, temples, and journeys, we decided on the spot.

It's essential to have Japanese yen as most temple tickets, souvenirs, amulets, and some trams (if you want a seat) only accept cash.

I exchanged $50,000 Japanese yen for this trip, and I had around $15,000 left at the end.
#### Travel
#### 🛫

With less than a month before departure, we quickly found a flight on [SkyScanner](https://www.skyscanner.com.tw){:target="_blank"} that suited our spontaneous pace:

Taipei &lt;\-&gt; Kansai
- 5/22 `EVA Air BR 130` 13:35 TPE \-&gt; KIX 17:15 (actually delayed by over 1 hour, arrived in Japan at 18:40)
- 5/29 `EVA Air BR 177` 11:10 KIX \-&gt; TPE 13:05

Round trip: `$14,915`

It seems that since last year, the baggage check-in has changed to a combination of piece and weight system, with one piece per person weighing up to 23kg; additional charges apply for anything extra.

> **Buying flight tickets with a credit card often includes travel insurance, so it's recommended to purchase tickets separately for each individual and check the insurance coverage of the credit card, as some debit cards may not have it.**

You can also opt for additional travel insurance (medical, inconvenience, loss, accident, etc.) for around $1,500 for an 8-day trip.
#### The Flight Tracker

I recommend installing [The Flight Tracker App](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/the-flight-tracker/id533365777){:target="_blank"} to input flight information and track real-time flight details, including terminals, boarding gates, and baggage claim information. (It provides notifications for any changes, but it's always best to rely on on-site information.)

![You can enable iOS Live Activity feature to track in real time a few hours before the plane takes off](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Sx7YU5RDmVm028kcwZzNNQ.png)

You can enable iOS Live Activity feature to track in real time a few hours before the plane takes off
#### 📲

I directly bought an 8-day unlimited data SIM card from KKDAY for about $700; there is also an E-SIM version, but I prefer to switch physical SIM cards as I feel more secure.
- You can carry the SIM card (including the SIM card pin) with you, and switch to a Japanese SIM card on the plane after a safe landing
- Remember to turn on roaming after switching, and then restart your device
- Unlimited data in Japan may not be truly unlimited; it may be throttled after reaching a certain usage limit, please inquire with the seller for details; it is recommended to use Wi-Fi for video calls or streaming

#### 🚈

You can use Sucia watermelon card directly on trains, subways, or buses; it is also accepted at some convenience stores and shops.

For iPhone users, you can directly add a virtual Sucia card by going to "Wallet & Apple Pay" -> "Add Card" -> "Transit Card" -> "Japan" -> "Sucia".


> To top up with a Master Card, I failed to top up with a Visa card; **It is recommended to top up in Taiwan in advance, otherwise, you may find yourself unable to top up or receive SMS verification codes in Japan, rendering the card unusable.**



If you cannot use iPhone Sucia or Android; physical Sucia cards in Japan are currently out of stock, so you can only purchase the 28-day Welcome Suica limited-time watermelon card, which can be topped up and used, **but it will become invalid after the expiration date and no refunds are available**.


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gae6qhvGRJPz4mU5of-Ciw.png)


Apple Watch also supports Suica (not interchangeable with iPhone), remember to set it up and top up in Taiwan beforehand.

When using the iPhone transit card, you do not need to bring up the Apple Pay interface specifically when tapping; just take out your device and tap directly (it will wake up the interface automatically).
#### Accommodation

I mainly used [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com){:target="_blank"} to find places near train and subway stations.
#### Kyoto 2 nights: [Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/index.php/china/search/detail/00027/){:target="_blank"}

Toyoko Inn was recommended by friends from Northeast Asia, it is a chain hotel with high value for money and reliable quality, and it includes a Japanese-style breakfast (rice ball or curry rice).

Due to booking late, only Toyoko Inn Shijo Omiya in Kyoto had available rooms; it is about 3 kilometers away from Kyoto Station:


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*YHktsP2WIZdgMmR6mbCeFg.png)


`NT$3,844 for 2 persons`
#### Osaka 4 nights: [APA Hotel Osaka Umeda](https://www.agoda.com/apa-hotel-osaka-umeda/hotel/osaka-jp.html?cid=1844104){:target="_blank"}

Due to late booking, there were limited choices; we chose another chain hotel, APA, which is closer to the station but slightly more expensive; it does not include breakfast but has facilities such as a swimming pool, public baths, etc.

It is about a 15-minute walk from Osaka Umeda Station:


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*CReJWCYGJK4-q6cUpWjM1g.png)


`NT$21,459 for 2 persons`
#### Pre-entry application (Fast track)

No need to apply for a visa, no need to provide COVID vaccine/nucleic acid proof; after booking flights and accommodation, you can fill in the entry information on Visit Japan, and once your phone connects to the internet after landing, you can directly enter the country, if not pre-applied, you will have to fill out a paper form on the spot.

Remember to check the [airport shuttle official website](https://www.tymetro.com.tw/tymetro-new/tw/_pages/travel-guide/timetable.php){:target="_blank"} for **direct shuttle** schedules before heading out. It's better to control the actual time to the airport; **be sure to take the direct shuttle**.

#### Waiting for the flight

Leaving too early + pre-boarding, there's still nearly 3 hours after exiting before takeoff.

Surprisingly, there's Xingbo Coffee!

![Delayed landing led to a delay of over an hour for takeoff](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*sj6-szSL_3W0ZPeDnC-pYA.jpeg)

Due to a delayed landing, the takeoff was delayed by over an hour.

Not sure if it's because of pre-boarding, the ground staff announced our names during the waiting time to confirm our presence and boarding.

![Bye 🇹🇼](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gOQ5Dcp9tuqVrENowSuSCw.jpeg)

Bye 🇹🇼

After the plane landed, changed to a Japanese SIM card and connected to the internet, then logged into [Vista Japan](https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/main/#/vjwpco001){:target="_blank"} to complete the immigration and customs procedures.

#### Heading to Kyoto

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*BOlV6ZOZ1wu1CcFuZGunKw.png)

After clearing customs at Kansai Airport, we directly took the `JR Kanku Special Rapid Service HARUKA` to `Kyoto Station`, about 1.5 hours, with only a few stops along the way.

It's recommended to buy tickets at the ticket machine to ensure you have a seat.

![Seeing the iconic Kyoto Tower right after leaving the station](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*3DP2os8MPHenEIZFVQ4nQg.jpeg)

Seeing the iconic Kyoto Tower right after leaving the station

Then took a taxi to the hotel (didn't take the bus because of luggage, otherwise there would be a bus available); combined with the flight delay, we arrived at the hotel around 9 pm on the first day.

![Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*iyI_iir-8y35RrTeMiVk2Q.png)

[Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya](https://www.toyoko-inn.com/index.php/china/search/detail/00027/){:target="_blank"}

There was a staff member at the hotel reception who spoke Chinese, so I asked her for advice on tomorrow's itinerary for a smoother experience - very friendly and convenient!

[![Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1b07_hqdefault.jpg "Toyoko Inn Kyoto Shijo Omiya")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-TCPJ1a4c8){:target="_blank"}

The room was cool, with two single rooms connected by a shared bathroom with a full-length mirror.

![Hanamaru Kaiten Sushi Seisakujo Omiya Store](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vVM39pBMcUF08ZwVmhEFHQ.jpeg)

[Hanamaru Kaiten Sushi Seisakujo Omiya Store](https://goo.gl/maps/gPPVsxyS7T7ZXFpp9){:target="_blank"}

It was late, so after settling in at the hotel, we went out nearby to find something to eat and decided on a skewer restaurant.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*tBd64pSc8p58LVQMZSIwxg.jpeg)



![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*zq67bnypeGpEz3ynSXudSQ.jpeg)

![Plum Tea Rice](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RUAalr6Hx6Kl5MyKBpQR1g.jpeg)

Plum Tea Rice

Starting at 80 yen per skewer, fresh, delicious, and cheap! Unexpectedly delightful, but when we wanted to visit again the next day, the shop was closed. QQ

After eating, we went to the convenience store LAWSON to buy some late-night snacks to continue eating at the hotel:

![Soy Sauce Fried Noodles](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-LbI46XU6lZ0Ue7NWXiq6g.jpeg)

The soy sauce fried noodles were just okay, but they felt heavy to eat.

### Day 2 (Kiyomizu-dera, Kinkaku-ji, Kyoto Tower)

In the early morning, we packed breakfast downstairs and ate in the room:

![Curry Rice](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*5QWczrQqnTk-aj8Qyt1Ziw.jpeg)

Curry rice, a bit too heavy for breakfast, prefer Western or Taiwanese breakfast.

#### Yasaka Shrine

After breakfast, we took a bus to Yasaka Shrine:

![Yasaka Shrine](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-iXEQYC4rtsUMhU2uByLlA.jpeg)

We walked to Kiyomizu-dera along the way:

![Kiyomizu-dera](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-GQLPV-UL9G0m9_LDpBQxw.jpeg)

Kyoto's streets are so clean that even the roadside cement blocks are not dirty.

![Yasaka Pagoda](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*1R_RQc0Yvx_z-FFQpv_kPQ.jpeg)

Yasaka Pagoda

Stopped at a shop halfway for iced matcha and black sugar dumplings:

![Iced Sake Ice Cream](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AcjpEeRkNcjtTluWqvPzbg.jpeg)

#### Kiyomizu-dera

Arrived at Kiyomizu-dera:

![Kiyomizu-dera](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*bXj9AKFMhbPZY3coeN7G5Q.jpeg)

The sun was scorching, and there were many people.

![Otowa Waterfall](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*PVpYqaRMj-bT_uiX-8L7Mw.png)

Otowa Waterfall

Lined up to pray for success in academics, love, health, and longevity at the waterfall.

After the visit, we walked back to Yasaka Shrine, casually ate a rice bowl and bought a cup of coffee on the way:

![Rice Bowl](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*X8zLHy7qQAGXDLcEYUw8pg.jpeg)

**In the afternoon, took a bus to "Kaohsiung"... (just kidding, it's Kinkaku-ji)**

![Kinkaku-ji](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*dpfIGuJWmJpg6HjhHNS0_g.jpeg)

After getting off the bus, it takes about a 15-minute walk to reach Kinkaku-ji:

#### Kinkaku-ji

![Kinkaku-ji](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*SNjSHhgouBBxuCC-sinp9g.jpeg)

![Kinkaku-ji](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*l2YQe7RomWZR2ruZ18dBXg.jpeg)

![Kinkaku-ji](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*GcsrNE8nqnDep6E6ZqgqvQ.jpeg)

The bus stop on the way back was crowded, so if you're agile, like us, you can walk to the next intersection to catch another bus route and avoid the crowd, heading to Kyoto Tower.

#### Kyoto Tower

Around 5:30 pm, we arrived at the Kyoto Tower observation deck:

![Kyoto Tower](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AN__sVqUBCJgvFY_ybee7A.jpeg)

You can overlook Kyoto from the tower, and there's a bar downstairs. We planned to go down to rest and come back up for the night view, but we found out that re-entry was not allowed once we went down, so we gave up.

![Kyoto Tower](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*H7yOZRfu1ly0jIXSG418zA.jpeg)

Here's a photo of the Kyoto Tower night view taken from outside after we left. (The weather was really nice)

![Cute Souvenirs](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Y7IljE0fXrQX-YFkuF2qWw.jpeg)


Cute little things

Go to the convenience store and buy some instant noodles for supper at the hotel.
### Day 3 (Arashiyama, Osaka)

Didn't have breakfast at the hotel the next day, got up early, checked out, stored luggage, and headed to Arashiyama.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*R7hF2Yz8z0Qd7H7qm_0GnQ.jpeg)


Shijo Omiya is the starting station, take it directly to the final station Arashiyama, very convenient and always have seats.
#### Arashiyama

Arrival:


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ywvHbpWCmqgfB4lukfyDdQ.jpeg)


First, walk towards Arashiyama after arrival:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_opLaTgAFt5liqk1iRNAwg.jpeg)


You can experience taking a boat to see the river view (similar to Bitan in Taiwan?)

**For those with good physical strength, you can choose a small hike:**


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vVMBkstwBLLm6_X_rihRaQ.jpeg)


We went hiking to see monkeys and the panoramic view. It takes about 30-45 minutes from the bottom of the mountain to the top, not difficult to walk.

![There are really monkeys](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*JxJFLvqV6MKv2eigxdz9tw.jpeg)

There are really monkeys

After descending, on the way back, we had lunch with tempura soba noodles:


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*FdUuFkOpbeqlypLHHLf6sA.jpeg)


Ordered wrong, shouldn't have ordered tempura rice, it became soba noodles + tempura rice hole.

After eating, head in another direction towards "Tenryu-ji Temple":
#### Tenryu-ji Temple

Come out from the back door of Tenryu-ji Temple and go directly to the bamboo forest:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*pJqXFzjX2tQ1F6AzTwt23Q.png)


There are really a lot of people, find a good angle for photos 🥵


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*6tJDVERUxEXhutzQrXfuow.jpeg)


It's also beautiful to take photos from bottom to top.

Return to Shijo Omiya to the hotel to pick up luggage and prepare to go to Osaka:


![The hotel is right outside Hankyu Omiya Station](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*wRzZYp5OBKid9GBqn308nw.jpeg)

The hotel is right outside Hankyu Omiya Station

When I first came here on the first day, I felt a bit inconvenient because it was a distance from Kyoto Station; but later I found it was actually great; it's the central point of Kinkaku-ji and Kiyomizu-dera, there is a direct tram to Arashiyama when you come out, and it's also direct to Osaka (remember about an hour).


![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*lM5wSwMr4TJO0XZN1fAlqg.png)


When first arriving in Osaka, it's easy to get lost, there are many exits, Osaka and Umeda are actually the same location.

The hotel rooftop has a free outdoor swimming pool, a convenience store inside the hotel, and a free public bath.

After dropping off the luggage, go out to find food:

There is a bear in the amusement park that makes fun of itself!!

### Day 4 Osaka Castle, Tsuruhashi, Nintendo

Following the instructions on Google Maps, take the train and then walk to Osaka Castle. The walking part from the station to the moat and then to the main castle takes about 30 minutes, a bit of a distance.

> **_The line at the ticket counter is very long, you can purchase tickets online [here](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/155057?cid=19365&ud1=76d66c2e34af){:target="_blank"} to enter without waiting._**

#### Osaka Castle

View of Osaka from the top:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*6R4txDuX0m72KK4iH4tMDQ.jpeg)

There is a history of the Warring States on each floor inside:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_MzKCjC8Makb94z085fzEg.jpeg)

After leaving Osaka Castle, we walked around nearby and looked for food.

Then we went to the outskirts of Tsuruhashi to buy some things at small shops.

#### Tsuruhashi

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ILqXij71VdF4mdNq-vqovQ.jpeg)

We walked around Tsuruhashi, which seems to be a non-touristy area with few tourists; quite a few Korean peripheral shops, more like a Korean town for Japanese people.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*AqWknhZOFjA2Z71PFfrvsQ.jpeg)

Just came to find some Korean cultural and creative items, later found out that Taiwan also sells them -_-

#### Nintendo

After walking around Osaka for a long time, my feet couldn't take it anymore; fortunately, on the way back, we stopped by Nintendo when returning to Osaka Umeda Station.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*xj413-aR0XpGTN0ewEA29g.jpeg)

Osaka Nintendo is located upstairs at Daimaru Department Store next to the station.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Abyl6hUb_Q7JKuQJ02Njiw.jpeg)

Went crazy buying The Legend of Zelda merchandise:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*9jo2K8KLDpJYn99_sKyjng.jpeg)

Everything is of high quality, the badges are made of metal, and the workmanship is very delicate.

### Day 5 Universal Studios

> [**_KKday Universal Studios Japan \| Universal Express Pass_**](https://www.kkday.com/en/product/18618?cid=19365&ud1=76d66c2e34af){:target="_blank"} 

Didn't buy the Express Pass, didn't go to Super Mario World early in the morning to queue up; we took a relaxed and casual approach and entered the park after 10 a.m.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*hnEaw3xDmUtJ8s9oWbOgLw.jpeg)

There were a lot of people entering the park, so we quickly checked the Super Mario World tickets on the app; luckily, the expert [Huang Xinping](https://medium.com/u/eac9088ed800){:target="_blank"} won the 5 p.m. entry qualification for Super Mario World.

First, we went to the Harry Potter themed area:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*26bNykqgbS5f1s3AQyPq4Q.png)



![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EhwXuclmBE4vdFFcntw_wg.jpeg)

![Butterbeer](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*zGOIfNIMihJ9q6SS1NSTPw.jpeg)

Butterbeer

We queued to buy Butterbeer (non-alcoholic, very sweet); felt that if we really wanted to collect it, we should buy the most expensive glass.

Next stop, Jurassic Park:

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*d6Q__KSmajuK0UZPnV_ZZQ.jpeg)

We queued for the rides, about 45 minutes wait; sat in the front row.

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*-Zi4CLnaYNTb6s4NFfOZag.jpeg)



![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*En62Hiyumf-rpBd1N0HVNw.jpeg)



![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Xwd9qgtHOhU_u8VtbB_C9w.jpeg)

Similar to a volcano adventure, it will rush down at the end 🥵 (I'm afraid of the feeling of weightlessness).

[![USJ Jussia Park](/assets/76d66c2e34af/3381_hqdefault.jpg "USJ Jussia Park")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT6HG_S1eK0){:target="_blank"}

But fortunately, I still had fun. Later, I saw the news that this facility will be reorganized starting in June and will probably be closed for a few years.

#### After playing, started wandering around and looking for food around noon

![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vnmxVIqJrfEnrXb8GHNhtA.jpeg)



![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*EYtfOe9nHxQ3oU-AnOEd2w.jpeg)



![](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*LWdvXTdLr7dpvDZ9DJdJxQ.jpeg)

The scenery inside is very realistic, you would think you are in the 🇺🇸 without saying it.

#### NO LIMIT! Parade!

[![NO LIMIT! Parade featuring Pokémon & Mario Kart First Performance - Universal Studios Japan](/assets/76d66c2e34af/4619_hqdefault.jpg "NO LIMIT! Parade featuring Pokémon & Mario Kart First Performance - Universal Studios Japan")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6O7iCsHpvg){:target="_blank"}

![Yoshi!!](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*iNe18pEWD5-B0-_IGjIFdA.png)

Yoshi!!

Unexpectedly fun at the beginning, the melody is still in my mind today!

There will be floats (Mario, Pokémon, Sesame Street... characters) and dancers leading the parade, stopping at each section to get everyone to dance together! All staff, including those maintaining order, will also dance together, creating a strong sense of involvement!

#### Super Mario World

East and west sway, around five o'clock head to Super Mario World.

![Image 1](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*gBhAC7fmzC88fOJCEfwcsg.jpeg)

![Image 3](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2dRBvOGNsJqIEacTXerBUg.jpeg)

I have to admire the scene design, completely bringing the game world to reality, like stepping into a paradise!

As it was close to closing time, I didn't buy a watch to play interactive scenes, just went to queue for Yoshi's facility.

![Image 4](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Fu7eeY_5bPGKDPOFbnFUJQ.jpeg)

![Image 8](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Yv35pE__YYy5-9zz1GzUAg.jpeg)

Every detail is done very delicately!

#### Farewell

Before closing, I took some night views of Universal Studios, many crowded places became great for photography.

![Image 9](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ocpZz_rQfIkj7FuET1w3xg.jpeg)

![Image 10](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*pbZcIUZRL2Yu1c_bFNvSjQ.jpeg)

Especially in the Harry Potter themed area, the scenes originally crowded with wand interactions were empty before closing, saw a sister playing alone and enjoying every interactive scene XD

![Image 11](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Zqz4M7W4SY8LcYyhpoBRUg.png)

![Image 12](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*3gdoxcodfV0aj6zeNUVXrw.jpeg)

Finally took a picture of the globe, goodbye Universal.

At night, had izakaya dinner, bought Nissin instant noodles as a midnight snack (after eating back and forth, this is still the best).

![Image 13](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2NGQ9V5hEPmNMO9uzk3shQ.jpeg)

### Day 6 Kobe, Dotonbori

Early in the morning, took a train to Kobe.

![Image 14](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*MMX0boFOG6L5SbBrWWcS9g.jpeg)

First went to explore Kobe shopping street.

![Image 15](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*rwKM6_Zww3PeGl2AW2q-dg.png)

Tried the famous Kobe beef croquette.

![Image 16](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RAeMaoiRVFmqK6HqZwP1Og.jpeg)

Walked from the shopping street to Kobe Port.

![Image 17](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*eTgGzkj137X3SBpNt9e06A.jpeg)

![Image 18](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*tHKgOArJAFTc7MyJ2ELfPQ.jpeg)

Realized Kobe Tower was under maintenance QQ

![Completion time details uncertain](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*5oUCxrlF0IfmbRj-jKnwnw.jpeg)

Completion time details uncertain

On the way back, strolled through the streets of Kobe.

![Image 19](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*BYf32j2Xz3yseNNI6yGzwA.png)

![Image 20](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*4g_Tw4Vk2JgJhHUUdMf8LQ.jpeg)

Found a cafe in Kobe to take a break:

![Image 21](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*jH413eSBntykPmEbNxXZzQ.jpeg)

Strawberry chocolate milkshake, tasty but very sweet.

#### Dotonbori

From Kobe to Dotonbori

Had dinner at the famous [Osaka Shinsekai Kushikatsu Ittoku](https://www.to-kosan.com/){:target="_blank"}.

![Image 22](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*rdPx5g8ibozpMfvC5eIwIQ.jpeg)

![Image 23](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*b7LkMARjX_7jiEj5fArxgQ.jpeg)

After eating, started the tourist itinerary, took photos of landmarks, and went to a drugstore to shop.

![Image 24](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*xtQlCtcM9ot1bUp5yG7Pcw.png)

![Glico](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*GL3js8GJMELapzXiSNQ-hg.jpeg)

Glico

Back to Taiwan and only realized I took the wrong photo after checking [IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrSgDNDvUYH/){:target="_blank"} XD. There are better photo spots when entering from the nearby department store.

Back to the hotel to continue eating instant noodles and drinking sake as supper.

![No impression of the taste](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2UhMnFMRaGlxo3SWuAzwgg.jpeg)

No impression of the taste

### Day 7 Koshien, Namba, Drugstores, Shopping

Last day countdown to return to Taiwan, a sightseeing itinerary.
#### Koshien, failed to check in

Decided impulsively in the early morning to go to Koshien to watch the Hanshin Tigers baseball game, took the subway to Koshien Station.

![Koshien Baseball Stadium](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*jub3IRmKUp3J47biO6Plrg.jpeg)

The Koshien Baseball Stadium is right outside the station.

![Koshien Baseball Stadium](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*vgXRR6pO2HykF2XWkU-Buw.jpeg)

But we were out of luck, unlike in Taiwan where there are always seats at baseball games, all Hanshin games were sold out until July; you have to buy tickets early, otherwise, you can only do a day trip outside the stadium.

Finally, we had something to eat nearby, bought some Hanshin Tigers souvenirs, and went to Cafe de L'ambre for a coffee before leaving.

![I always thought it was called "Coffee Place"](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*2py39zcMErSshqtbURXgbA.jpeg)

I always thought it was called "Coffee Place"

#### Namba

After leaving Koshien, we went to Namba for shopping.

![Namba Shopping](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*Hmlb6Zq_w6yDoY4gZUhXSQ.png)

Also had some takoyaki and crab legs by the roadside.

![Takoyaki and Crab Legs](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*_C9tEPwHwVSOl4niFQnVQg.png)

![Takoyaki and Crab Legs](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*RmURVoIjSSS97T_HCWVufQ.png)

Perhaps we went to the wrong store, felt quite ordinary.

Walked back to Dotonbori and headed to the original Don Quijote store.

![Only the original store has a Ferris wheel](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*ZCvf4uNNeBgHO9l6gITqEA.jpeg)

Only the original store has a Ferris wheel

After shopping, we returned to Osaka in the evening and found an izakaya near our accommodation for our final dinner.

![Final dinner in Osaka](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*79m0d5nrZ5eBJS3GTMfdSg.jpeg)

![Final dinner in Osaka](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*VWGKN_9NAENw4k_FyNjiLQ.png)

Took one last look at the Osaka night view.
#### Day 8 Return Journey

The flight was at noon, so we checked out at 7 am to head to Kansai Airport.

![Kansai Airport](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*S8ztBQbh8T4A03erJejgTg.jpeg)

The weather in Osaka changed today, it started to rain, fitting for the farewell mood.

![Osaka skyline as a farewell](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*wALoeYw7vetSaC5cz1U5tw.jpeg)

Took a final photo of the Osaka skyline as a farewell.

> Originally planned to take the train to Kansai Airport, but dragging luggage up and down; the day before, I specifically explored the bus route back (including time and station location). Went to the bus station early in the morning to check the crowd, luckily there weren't many people in line, so we bought bus tickets to Kansai Airport and comfortably took the bus directly to Kansai Airport.

![Enjoying the last Osaka skyline along the way](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*D1vu7K69LugUXZA6tXieJg.png)

![Long queue at the counter upon arrival at the airport](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*YAeZK91NqBpCFDK9eFm5SA.jpeg)

Finally found the troubleshooting counter, we completed the online check-in with just a click and could go directly to the luggage check-in counter! Saved almost an hour.

> Actually, I really want to tell the people queuing, if you open the webpage now and click to receive the e-ticket, you can go to check in your luggage and then go through immigration.

After going through immigration, there weren't many food options or stores under renovation at Kansai Airport, so I ended up buying a tonkatsu curry toast from New World.

![Image](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*H_edW4jnC7qqiEArQBXSDg.jpeg)

Waiting to board the flight back to Taiwan.

![Image](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*VKaFk3yiIBi2bqcFSL5Gyw.jpeg)

Safely arrived in Taiwan in the afternoon, time to rest at home! 🇹🇼

### Loot

![Image](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*sbi4h728VMU194WAVz2fYQ.jpeg)

![Image](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*qgp-9OrzQtrZuNnXY1yEXw.jpeg)

![Image](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*QeatVpK3I4QxmRDignMTfg.jpeg)

Didn't buy much actually, just bought whatever caught my eye; after comparing, I found that the drugstore coming out of Kyoto Station was the cheapest (about $100-$300 yen cheaper than Osaka), with Don Quijote being the most expensive.

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnx85z78O2w)

The theme song of Yodobashi is really catchy, got brainwashed right after strolling in Kyoto.

The duty-free shopping rule in Japan requires a minimum of ¥5,000 to be eligible for tax exemption with your passport. They seal the items in a plastic bag, which you can only open upon returning home (the photos were taken at home; if you open it within the country and get checked upon exiting, you may have to pay taxes, but it didn't seem like they were checking; remember to note that liquids can only be checked in, if there are liquids inside the sealed items, they must be checked in as a whole).

Apart from famous snacks, I mostly looked for local products from century-old shops, can't guarantee they're delicious but they're guaranteed to be century-old; the recommended snacks by everyone are guaranteed to be delicious, but be prepared to queue + they're not century-old XD

In the end, it's best to find delicious food!

### Afterword

Fell in love with Japan on my first visit, already planning my next trip back.

> Actually, I went to Tokyo again from 6/7-11 😝 Stay tuned for the next episode of my travelogue

Overall, convenient transportation, peaceful, pleasant weather (in May, it feels like autumn in Taiwan, cool at night), people have boundaries and are polite; really loved it!

In terms of expenses, considering the current exchange rate and prices, it's actually cheaper than Taiwan...

#### Accommodation and Transportation:
- Trains and buses have higher coverage and are more convenient than in Taiwan; only took a taxi on the first day to the hotel.
- Despite the convenience of transportation, Japan is vast, so you'll need to walk a lot, averaging about 20,000 steps a day.
- Standing on the left or right isn't consistent, in Kyoto it's left, in Osaka it's right.
- Buses wait for passengers to sit before departing, and wait for passengers to stand up and alight slowly; so there's no need to start moving before reaching your stop, the Japanese don't like that.
- Hotel bathrooms are very clean and comfortable; even the smallest ones have bathtubs.
- Almost all toilets are high-tech, some in department stores even have background water sounds (to avoid embarrassment).

![Peak Steps 5/23-5/28](/assets/76d66c2e34af/1*qmwiX0LqkOv-izZIFSqHeA.jpeg)

Peak Steps 5/23-5/28

#### Culture:
- Clean and uniform cityscape (e.g. all entrances look the same, no variation in having shoe cabinets or not, if one has it, they all do, if not, none do).
- No eating while walking, people finish eating at the store entrance before moving on.
- Trash must be taken back to the hotel, there are few trash cans on the streets, so it's convenient to return the trash to the store after eating at the entrance.
- Stores only accept their own trash.
- Basic English is not widely understood, simple gestures or translation apps are used; but drugstores and large shopping centers usually have Chinese-speaking staff.
- When buying tickets, receiving receipts, giving or receiving change, remember to place directly on/from the tray, avoid direct contact with the staff.
- Avoid physical contact and standing too close.
- Public transport is generally very quiet, especially on buses.
- **When taking photos, try not to shoot directly at people or their faces, blur faces before uploading to social media.**
- When photographing temples, take angled shots, not straight-on.
- Emphasis on detailed SOP, and it doesn't seem easy to blend in with Japan.
- Japanese people generally dress very formally or at least stylishly, even women are very refined.

> Also, don't criticize others, we encountered a group from Taiwan (they had 🇹🇼 on their bags) similar to a direct sales company's employees at Universal Studios, loudly shouting slogans and repeatedly filming "super awesome, performance is awesome" in the middle of the road, blocking the way; it was embarrassing.

#### Returning to work and "products"

In my opinion, if you want to enter the Japanese market, relying solely on advertising and marketing might be challenging, at most attracting some curious individuals; Japan has a strong cultural unity, so you need to find a way to integrate into their lives and habits to have a chance at winning their hearts.

In addition, the fault tolerance is very low, for example, bugs, unexpected appearance of other languages; for us, it may be okay once or twice, or at least not happening frequently; for them, I think it could be a disaster with just one occurrence because this thing is not rigorous enough and does not value them.
