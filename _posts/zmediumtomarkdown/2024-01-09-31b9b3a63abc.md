### \[Travelogue\] 2023 Hiroshima Okayama 6-Day Free Trip

2023 Hiroshima, Okayama, Fukuyama, Kurashiki, Onomichi 6-Day Trip

### Preface

After leaving my job at the end of August, I immediately set off in September for the "[10-Day Solo Stroll in Kyushu](../d78e0b15a08a/)" and rested for almost three months. Originally, I planned to start work in mid-November. With a new project and no extra leave at the new company, I had to accumulate annual leave according to the basic labor laws. Therefore, I considered going on another trip (planned at the end of October).
#### Destination — Hiroshima (Okayama)

Last time, an [unexpected incident on the way to Nagasaki](../d78e0b15a08a/) — received a souvenir from Mihara City, Hiroshima Prefecture. After visiting the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum and Peace Park, I thought it would be nice to visit Hiroshima as well.

Friends also recommended Hiroshima, which has World Heritage sites like Itsukushima Shrine, oysters, the Seto Inland Sea, Onomichi, Rabbit Island...

Since it was another solo trip, I didn't consider big cities or places I'd already visited. I wanted convenient transportation, and Hiroshima was a great choice!
#### Dates — 11/13–18

Originally, I planned to start work on 11/20 (Monday, later postponed to 12/1). Deducting the last day for rest, the return date was set for 11/18 (Saturday).

For the departure date, I had plans with friends on 11/12, so I aimed to leave on 11/13 (Monday). However, since I hadn't started working yet, my schedule was flexible, mainly depending on when the airfare was cheaper.
#### A Series of Twists and Turns

**❌ The most intuitive way to get to Hiroshima is through Hiroshima Airport, but the conditions were very unfavorable:**
- Time: Late arrival (17:20) and early departure (09:30); no flights on Saturdays, so I would have to return on Friday (11/17).
- Location: Requires a shuttle bus (about 55 minutes). After landing, the only buses are at 21:40 or 22:20 (last bus), reaching the station at 22 or 23 o'clock, which is very late.
- Price: ~=$17,000, too expensive.


**❌ Fukuoka in and out + Shinkansen, still inconvenient:**
- Time: Arrival (16:30), departure (10:55), also late arrival and early departure, but slightly better.
- Location: Convenient transportation, but it takes about 1.5 hours by Shinkansen to Hiroshima.
- Price: ~=$12,000; if I wanted a late return (20:35), it would be ~=$17,000 or an early flight at 06:50.


**❌ Later found out that I could go to Hiroshima via Tigerair to Okayama, but the motivation was average:**
- Time: Arrival (11:10), departure (15:25), great timing.
- Location: Okayama Airport also requires a shuttle bus, but the landing time is early, so there's plenty of time.
- Price: Including +20 KG checked baggage, round trip about ~= $14,000.


Since I had just spent money on the "[10-Day Kyushu Trip](../d78e0b15a08a/)" in September, if the airfare couldn't be kept around 10,000, I wasn't very motivated to go, so I almost gave up on this trip.

**✅ [Tigerair Okayama Winter Travel Event](https://static.tigerairtw.com/www/events/OKJ23winter/index.html){:target="_blank"}, Departure:**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Agd-DC4jUc5xcvez71cIVw.png)


On 10/31, while bored and browsing Facebook, I happened to see a post in the "[Japan Free Travel Discussion Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/207266832755595/){:target="_blank"}" about an airline discount event. I saw that [Tigerair](https://static.tigerairtw.com/www/events/OKJ23winter/index.html){:target="_blank"} had a promotion from 11/3 10:00 to 11/6 23:59. So, I decided to go with the flow; if I got the discount, I'd go, if not, then so be it.

11/3 Early in the morning, I was lucky to get the best tickets with the best dates (11/13–18), the best flight times, and the best prices. There was no reason not to go!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*e7BeYsY5ov6J25hlOr2Wqw.png)

- Departure (11:10), Return (15:25), including 20KG checked baggage + seat selection + miscellaneous fees: **$7,012**

### Preparations

After buying the tickets, there was only one week left before departure, so I started preparing immediately.

The places I most wanted to visit were Miyajima, Onomichi, Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter, and Okayama Castle. Therefore, I decided to use Hiroshima as a base, stay there for several days, and stay near Okayama closer to the return date.
#### Transportation

[JR Pass Okayama & Hiroshima & Yamaguchi Area Rail Pass](https://www.klook.com/zh-TW/activity/5653-5-day-okayayama-hiroshima-yamaguchi-area-jr-pass/){:target="_blank"} (¥ 17,000, just in time before the price hike at the end of October 2023.)

A one-way trip from Okayama to Hiroshima costs ¥6,460, round trip ¥12,920. Considering trips to Miyajima, Onomichi, Kure City, etc., it should be worth it. Buying the JR Pass is the most convenient option.
#### Accommodation (5 nights)

[**Toyoko INN Hiroshima Station Front**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sm8WnCdTk2qf2VgCA){:target="_blank"} **(3 nights)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-YwLmHr8op_lrrQY3SCd2g.png)

- Price: $4,612, $1,537/night, single non-smoking room
- Transportation: From the map, it looks quite close (actually about a 15-minute walk due to construction and having to cross a level crossing). It's not a bustling area, located outside Mazda Zoom-Zoom Stadium, which is very quiet now as there are no games.

Toyoko INN, as always, offers great value for money, with the best price and environment for this stay.

[**APA Hotel Hiroshima-Ekimae Ohashi**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dSk4agNLsMDA638Z9){:target="_blank"} **(1 night)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wt4pri9pUzkFiUZzZIgWOQ.png)

- Price: $2,501, 1 night, single non-smoking room
- Location: Closer to Hiroshima Station, but still not an easy walk, requiring crossing a major road and a bridge (about 10 minutes). It's about a 15-minute walk from the previous accommodation, making it convenient.

Since I couldn't book four nights at Toyoko INN, I had to stay one night at APA Hotel.

[**Hotel Livemax Okayama Kurashiki Ekimae**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pcPAvCaaH4mzo36o6){:target="_blank"} **Livemax (1 night)**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*F5rO356jsxQwugfbxANN8w.png)

- Price: $3,263, 1 night, single non-smoking room
- Location: As shown on the map, it's just outside Kurashiki Station, about a five-minute walk, very convenient.

I chose Kurashiki because I couldn't find an acceptable-priced hotel in Okayama. Kurashiki also has shuttle buses to Okayama Airport, so I decided to find a hotel near Kurashiki.

This was the only hotel in Kurashiki with available rooms, a convenient location, and an acceptable price.
#### Fun

The original plan was as follows:
- 11/13: Shopping, eating Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki
- 11/14: Miyajima, Hiroshima City: Itsukushima Shrine, Momijidani Park, Miyajima Ropeway -> Shishiiwa Observatory, Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Children's Peace Monument (Hiroshima Tower)
- 11/15: Onomichi, Senkoji Temple
- 11/16: Kure City, Hiroshima City (same as 11/14), Hiroshima Castle
- 11/17: Okayama, Kurashiki: Okayama Korakuen, Okayama Castle, Kibitsu Shrine, Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter, Kurashiki Outlet, Achi Shrine
- 11/18: Kurashiki Outlet, return trip

Rabbit Island is too far and inconvenient, so it's only on the reference list.
#### Go!

### Day 1 Departure

Flight departs at 11:10 AM, so I left home leisurely in the morning.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*yeEzGfYKPOkgTloqwikhmg.jpeg)

Took the Airport MRT from Taipei Main Station to Taoyuan Airport Terminal 1, arriving at the check-in counter around 08:50.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*JC4MGzSm0SyDbYDdU8SfvA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*224m8Mrtd6cq_NtNa1nE0w.jpeg)

Not many people, quickly completed check-in + departure; [Terminal 1](https://web.taoyuan-airport.com/services_facilities?p=1&m=9CBEA40D-B7AB-EB11-AB4D-D45D6481BBEB&t=1&a=2){:target="_blank"} didn't have much food, so I casually bought some TKK Fried Chicken + coffee and went to wait for the flight.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*l--F5TKOIv1R1VLw2xhL9Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Wm_YG0rPckM1iq_uUQ2Lgg.jpeg)

I wasn't very hungry while waiting for the flight, so I didn't eat what I bought.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*tE1ZkTG7TalQrmr3bsegUw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*lgXM2X4L-OXwTiEMpAi8Ug.jpeg)

11:07 takeoff, 14:11 arrival at OKJ (Okayama Momotaro Airport); when I got hungry in between and wanted to eat, I found out that Tigerair doesn't allow you to bring your own food on the plane (Peach Aviation doesn't have this rule), so I obediently held back, thinking I'd eat in a corner before going through immigration.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_zm48DE_q-bLr7FnUJPcEw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-SpeO3_twTbSibfVz4TufQ.jpeg)

Okayama Airport is super small, just followed the crowd and went straight through immigration, there was no corner to sneak food; because TKK Fried Chicken has chicken which might have quarantine issues, I handed the whole package to customs for destruction.

Around 14:40, I completed immigration + baggage claim (super fast). Later, I checked the flights, and Okayama Airport has very few flights, maybe only one international flight a day, so there were no people, only those from the same flight; customs and quarantine dogs check each person, but it's still very fast!

As soon as I came out, I got on the airport shuttle. Maybe because there are so few flights, according to the schedule, the next shuttle to Okayama Station was at **16:10**; but there was an extra shuttle right outside the airport that you could get on directly (it leaves when full, and there will be another one), very considerate to save everyone's time!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0gqW-PJ_7a0N1pvHtkwtEg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*JAe4i7XdyYcjdsQkjRDzwQ.png)

After getting off, I found the escalator going up to Okayama Station, first went to exchange the JR Pass, found the green machine with " **EXPRESS予約、5489 お受取** " written next to it to exchange the JR Pass ticket.

Previously found [exchange instructions](https://icepanda74.com/jr-west-pass/){:target="_blank"} online, which said to select the blue "予約したきっぷのお受取り" but no matter how I tried, following the steps, scanning the QR Code always resulted in "QR Code invalid" error, and entering the order number also failed.

Finally, after many attempts by a group of Taiwanese, we found out you need to use the yellow button " **QRコードの読取り** " on the bottom left to exchange, click it and scan the QR Code directly. (Guessing the JR machine has been updated)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*q7bTApvhtGL0JL1NIDoFDA.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*iWb8VSdUEYDonDQ6GDfmXQ.png)

The machine will spit out two instruction sheets, **one JR Pass (the ticket with ✔ in the picture)**, you can also insert it back to [complete seat reservation](../d78e0b15a08a/), **use the JR Pass ticket for entering and exiting stations**, the reserved seat ticket is only for reference for seat and time, it cannot be used for entering and exiting stations.

I was really hungry, hadn't eaten anything, so I went to a convenience store to buy some food, and therefore took a later JR train.

Arrived at Hiroshima Station around 16:45.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*oL8_C5_VSGO6QKeHnCbGOQ.jpeg)

First went to the hotel to check-in and drop off luggage before going out to find food. When there's no baseball game, this street is very quiet, opposite is the railway, and there are not many shops on the road, but luckily there is a large Lawson store.

![[Hiroshima Okonomiyaki Story Station Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"}](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*mIjh2c9lqbNQm1dug1HcrA.png)

[Hiroshima Okonomiyaki Story Station Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"}

Returning to the station to eat Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki at " [Hiroshima Okonomiyaki Story Station Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C8aLTG48rhfKwVQz6){:target="_blank"} " located on the 6th floor to the right after exiting Hiroshima Station (next to Ekie Department Store); as soon as you get off the elevator, it feels very special, the entire floor is filled with okonomiyaki restaurants, and you can choose your favorite one to sit in.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*31Pe4NiL7DBIaWdh-wbF-g.jpeg)

Ordered an okonomiyaki with added mochi (with fried noodles inside), the taste was average, but it was filling with noodles and mochi inside.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3H1rWAQ3rCQMNqY8wPXO6w.jpeg)

Bought a late-night snack on the way back to the hotel, it was very cold in Hiroshima at night, about 4 degrees.

Room unboxing.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*XQ38j0JGEvq6EbBB1VRA9g.jpeg)

Opening the curtains reveals the railway outside (about 10 tracks, so you need to cross the level crossing quickly); the downside of the room is the clattering sound when trains pass by.
#### [Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger + Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"}

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*7rDTJGw3sn-Xk4b1TfC_4w.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*G8U07uxOV7zPFg6olh148A.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kZ-W5Rp-BGzJfHs_FoE9JQ.jpeg)

This trip, I brought the [Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger + Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} combo. Since switching to the iPhone 15, all my devices now use Type-C ports; for travel, just bringing a Type-C charging cable solves everything.

[Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} supports single port 65W, dual port 45W+18W fast charging; it's small and portable, you can plug it into any available outlet while out; back at the hotel, you can charge a power bank with one port and a phone, watch, iPad, or Switch with the other, convenient and fast.

[Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} (1.5m) is long enough to use with a power bank in your bag, the liquid silicone material is different from regular plastic, it's skin-friendly, easier to bend and store, and doesn't get kinked.

The best charging partner for this trip.
### Day 2 Miyajima (Itsukushima Shrine), Momijidani Park, Mount Misen Observatory, Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park
#### Miyajima

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*pQa28CfaTuRI0Ov8nWosuQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*n-oYTJJ12FoJ8NsGKq4pmQ.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*pja550xC83kj8VUdfzbuoA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*09NEVdiOQ3PePi_cmthisA.jpeg)

Early in the morning, took the JR to Miyajimaguchi Station, walked towards the pier to find the ferry terminal; the JR Pass includes the Miyajima ferry ticket, no need to buy a ferry ticket, but you need to pay an additional [Miyajima Visit Tax (¥100)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%99%BB%E5%AE%AE%E5%B3%B6%E8%A8%AA%E5%9A%B4%E5%B3%B6%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE-2023%E5%B9%B410%E6%9C%881%E6%97%A5%E8%B5%B7%E9%96%8B%E5%BE%B5%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E7%A8%85-045414147.html){:target="_blank"} , there will be staff guiding you to buy the visit tax ticket.

> Alternatively, you can take the tram to Miyajimaguchi, but I remember it takes longer.

The ferry takes about 10 minutes to reach Miyajima. The ferry is very stable and doesn't have a diesel smell. As you approach, you can see the torii gate in the sea from afar!

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ZK3WATjmh5l9AbfbAGPQQg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0-nFldh1yauKTKAhd2FVGw.jpeg)

After landing on the island, head directly towards the torii gate in the sea. It's also beautiful to take slanted photos from the shore along the way, and there are fewer people.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*DA0LQI4M6jJ9mtd54QF0AA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-t-wQz9vGbpn7hk2T73g8g.jpeg)

There are also many wild deer on the island that will randomly bite things XD.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*BmkFwQBqVZ4gIc0QtEC_1Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Q1KjPX9_X186KhZgAyj0fA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*4UzgS1ocwWemFhgzR4QMVA.jpeg)

After passing through Itsukushima Shrine, head to the Miyajima Ropeway to the Shishiiwa Observatory.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*6T301OV5u4hrZ_2G2MmAYw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Tm7mBakYqAH4ajoIhGrhWg.jpeg)

You need to take two ropeways to reach the Shishiiwa Observatory. The advantage of going straight to the ropeway is that there are almost no people (a lot of people at the Itsukushima Shrine at the foot of the mountain). The first section is a small ropeway that can hold up to 6 people (departures are frequent, and the distance is longer). The second section is a larger ropeway (if I remember correctly, it departs every 15 minutes, can accommodate more people (about 20 people), and the distance is very short).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*FuEoMnObeAs0VV-JlHH79A.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*h_IfZzojUcGIsJ2eYWfyHQ.jpeg)

At the top of the mountain, you can overlook the entire Seto Inland Sea, enjoy the breeze, and look at the small islands. It's very pleasant.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*6yCjyDKNlfbicD60-2cD4w.jpeg)

Itsukushima Shrine is built directly on the seaside. The water is very clean, and walking around feels very serene. You can also queue up to take photos of the torii gate in the sea from the front.

The low tide times during this season are at 3 AM or 5 PM, so this time we didn't get a chance to see the Itsukushima Shrine and torii gate at low tide.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CSGcLd27TmbNDphGt6t_Iw.jpeg)

For lunch, of course, we had oysters. [Kakiya](https://tabelog.com/tw/hiroshima/A3402/A340202/34003363/){:target="_blank"}'s oyster rice and fried oysters, each costing over 300 TWD, were delicious and cheap. Oyster heaven!

Miyajima Ropeway and Itsukushima Shrine tickets.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*KgQ6iEBeEyuurbF5qw0rQQ.jpeg)

Bought a small torii gate from Itsukushima Shrine to take home. It's very cute!
#### Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Memorial Park

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*GFTu9nxh5cOyAO0CJXsRWg.jpeg)

In the afternoon, we returned to Hiroshima city and took a walk around the Atomic Bomb Dome and Peace Memorial Park.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*cLqb-Bs7wAQGPxtTqTM6Zw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wOgawnizU-WTwUl9cr959w.jpeg)

In autumn, Hiroshima is adorned with the yellow of ginkgo leaves, the red of maple leaves, and some green leaves, accompanied by the cool autumn breeze, reminiscing about everything that happened in Hiroshima.

> _In the Peace Memorial Park, I encountered many Japanese elementary and middle school students on field trips, with teachers explaining the history. It deeply impressed me with the importance the Japanese people place on historical education._

#### Return to the Hotel

We returned to the hotel to rest in the late afternoon because it was too cold outside as we were underdressed.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*QZZruRDOmdJ37ziaWWYZqA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*p-9ReufIDYbzkqls7rd3GA.jpeg)

For dinner, we bought takeout grilled meat bento boxes from "[Sumibi Yakiniku Bin Enkobashi Branch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1hjH3o1KZe9bFFx7){:target="_blank"}" on the way back to the hotel. This store initially caught my eye because there were several charcoal stoves placed at the entrance, which felt very warm when I walked by. After stopping to look at the signboard, I found out they offered takeout bento boxes, so I went in!

Another interesting thing is that the bento boxes have a self-heating function. When you pull a string, it starts to heat up and steam, so you can eat it hot anytime, which is very considerate.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*0RivogHw5D_eDTxmY4NZQQ.jpeg)

Tonight's convenience store snacks include a hot dog, fried chicken, Strong Zero, and a bottle of Yakult Y1000, which is said to help you sleep well. (But after walking all day, I would sleep well anyway.)

### Day 3 Onomichi, Senkoji Temple, Fukuyama, Tomonoura

In the morning, we took the Shinkansen to Mihara, then transferred to a train to Onomichi Station.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*I0K5vrSgtXKMRsyIvntREw.jpeg)

We didn't time it well and had to wait for over 30 minutes when transferring from Mihara to Onomichi.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*XUwZTLkI5AGZ-cP5CCVKjg.jpeg)

We exited Onomichi Station from the south exit.

The weather was nice and the temperature was just right. After exiting Onomichi Station, we walked all the way to Senkoji Temple. The side of the mountain felt like walking in Jiufen, with many stairs and steep slopes going up. Looking to the other side, you can see the Onomichi Inland Sea, and the scenery is quite nice.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*1cMVbuqTv1_LkV-wLt4VDQ.jpeg)

Another option is to walk directly along the main road until you see the sign for the Senkoji Ropeway, then turn in to take the ropeway up to Senkoji Temple.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wWrh70gToooi2TxjDmlhCw.jpeg)

The view from Senkoji Temple is excellent, offering a bird's-eye view of the entire Onomichi city and the distant Onomichi Bridge.

I brought home a cute little Jizo statue (you can choose to write down your wish and leave it at Senkoji Temple for offering or take it home as a souvenir):

After visiting Senkoji Temple, walking down leads to Cat Alley.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*oBkaEI0x4oZhYLWLwJ7ujA.jpeg)

Reading early internet articles, Cat Alley was introduced as a place in Japan's Onomichi, but visiting this year felt different; Cat Alley is a small path downhill from Senkoji Temple. I didn't see any stray cats, and most of the cat cafes along the way were closed. Walking down felt a bit lonely, and finally, I found a cafe that was still open, "[ブーケ ダルブル](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EEgG9QQ4JEhrgTv78){:target="_blank"}" to have a cup of coffee and rest.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_II1PZ_V5MIhU6gjjOKkpQ.png)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ANvCs92M_L6FjVOIACWxmg.png)

The location of the shop is good, but the way up also exudes a lonely, overgrown feeling. There aren't many seats inside, and the food choices are limited; but the owner is very enthusiastic, and the shop cat is very affectionate and will come sit next to you.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kOOBxwOOYrTrX6qg343Xpw.jpeg)

On the way back down to the main street, I encountered a very quiet local shrine.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hMEICjDgcA6MAC-XCe51Yw.jpeg)

On the way back to Onomichi Station, I walked through the inner shopping street and had the famous Onomichi Ramen for lunch — "[Onomichi Ramen Shoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CCD8F1HshTU59syb7){:target="_blank"}".

Onomichi Ramen (founded by a Taiwanese person) is quite special, with a lot of white pork back fat floating on top, and bamboo shoots.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*CTQVxiffaVYq9PhiVn2OXQ.jpeg)

After leisurely strolling back to Onomichi Station, since it was still early, I decided to head to nearby Fukuyama City.

> _Didn't calculate the time well, waited an extra 30 minutes for the train. Friends coming to Onomichi, remember to manage your time well._

#### Fukuyama

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*L5wZN7xGhmNyZ-Ml3ph_YQ.jpeg)

From the back of Fukuyama Station, you can see Fukuyama Castle. I didn't go in, just took a photo from afar and left.

#### **Tomonoura**

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ZafEophTKy92TAq14VGdYg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*iqqeITVAoMWdePr97Q6Gvw.jpeg)

Back at the front of Fukuyama Station, you can see the bus directions to "Tomonoura". Initially, looking at the map, Tomonoura seemed hard to reach because it's a small seaside town, but I have to admire Japan's tourism and transportation signs, which are very clear.

> p.s. Didn't do much research on Tomonoura beforehand, it was a spontaneous trip.

> My knowledge of Tomonoura was limited to it being the setting for "Ponyo on the Cliff", Japan's first modern port city, a negotiation site for Sakamoto Ryoma, and a must-visit for history enthusiasts.

After getting on the bus, ride to the final stop, which is Tomonoura (travel time: about 40 minutes).

#### Sensui Island

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*nGQpOr-F_uRH2ce3oRMTMw.jpeg)

I directly referred to the local tourist map and decided to visit Sensui Island first to see the scenery.

After getting off the bus, walk back to the "Fukuyama Municipal Ferry Terminal" to take a ferry to Sensui Island (about 10 minutes).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*937pWhC7CiWNGyG3S4oZyQ.jpeg)

The ship has an antique feel, giving a sudden sense of becoming a pirate king. Although the journey is short, you can overlook the Seto Inland Sea and Sensui Island, enjoy the breeze, and feel very comfortable.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*TUoVIqRtUWpR89LroEqCQA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*pZ9_AcETxbb9gxMRK04npw.jpeg)

After arriving on the island, I didn't see any passersby. The island was desolate, and the original Tomonoura Beach Visitor Center was closed and ready for demolition. The trails to other coastal areas on the mountain were also closed due to falling rocks. Only a bathhouse hotel at the entrance was still in business.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*lKqGg_lIDujVWlAs5pkCQA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*GxAW50j3unwnRdlMxyakfA.jpeg)

Tomonoura Beach only had a large, quiet beach left, with occasional sounds of a group of sea ducks playing. (It was also my first time seeing saltwater ducks, not saltwater chickens)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*aGuuliBewJVz_DW_lrDD1Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*BVcPUWx0WxZy5bZa4MSsZQ.jpeg)

I stayed for only about 15 minutes, with nowhere to go, and waited for the ferry to return. Although the place was desolate, there were still vending machines! On the way back, I took a closer look at Benten Island in the distance, a lonely island standing in the middle of the sea with a torii gate.
#### Tomonoura

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*L-jm3vDxb2-ZqtAmtvCHbA.jpeg)

Returning to Tomonoura, it was already close to evening. I wandered to the port to see the Tokoyo lantern and the Japanese-style town scenery. Many people and photography enthusiasts were already sitting on the steps by the port, setting up their cameras, waiting for the sunset.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*SeorqAWQs7qe8YLMkXwdPA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E3kD_XkOhHlG5FJSMQr7UQ.jpeg)

Tomonoura is famous for its health-preserving medicinal wine, and the streets were filled with the strong smell of medicinal wine. Since I had to rush back to Hiroshima, I took the bus back to Fukuyama before it got dark.

After returning to Fukuyama, I immediately boarded the train to Hiroshima, bidding farewell to this peaceful and serene city. For dinner, I bought a takeout barbecue bento from "[Sumibi Yakiniku Bin Enkobashi Branch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1hjH3o1KZe9bFFx7){:target="_blank"}" on the way back to the hotel.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*4rgR6XxTqCj3Ttl36q1FnQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*eaZ-_Cby5JKRX4nzyJJNkA.jpeg)

Additionally, I bought two fried oysters from a convenience store (only 100 yen each).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E0hLC9VLo4tah6MgxOEqog.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hZQQHGWrXR_hDRmEZ3EZhw.jpeg)

The late-night snack was still Y1000+ convenience store hot food.
### Day 4 Kure City, Hiroshima City Last Tour (Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Hiroshima Castle, Shukkeien Garden)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*WmcYfx8BQwNrVp_0SQJsEA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*vNoFiM5ZkznaCYLgdjHp7g.jpeg)

Early in the morning, I checked out of Toyoko INN and dragged my luggage to the Hiroshima APA Hotel where I would be staying that night.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*PthDRuEg7AES_KIzrFa-3A.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*GuEtFX9d9PA5Im7PLxkAcQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ef6aepg-6ERDvr5jJlxZ9A.jpeg)

After storing my luggage, I walked back to Hiroshima Station to take the train to Kure City (about 50 minutes). Nearing Kure City, looking out from the right window, it felt like returning to the Fulong and Yilan train routes, with mountains on the left and the sea on the right, the scenery was pleasant.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*gYNCT8nC5xaQ5cd6DpzSGA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_lyLdp5j60H-lRDZTBMURA.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*YffE_SVn5hs9c3AwrLBkwA.jpeg)

After exiting the station, you can go to the tourist information center to get a travel guide for Kure City. (I think the design is great!)

Follow the signs to walk from the station's sky bridge all the way to the Yamato Museum and the JMSDF Kure Museum at the port.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*WWo4EbbEMpeXQBf8eY9dow.jpeg)

When you reach the end, don't rush to get off the sky bridge. From the sky bridge, you can get a good view of the JMSDF Kure Museum — Submarine.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*c1BkFzWE_wr4tscbWg8hzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kPeWz4lsPF1vs4NzVNBneQ.jpeg)

> For friends planning a trip to Kure City and Hiroshima, you can also take a boat from Kure City to Miyajima and back to Hiroshima. I originally planned to take the boat back to Hiroshima, but the timing didn't work out, so I gave up this time.

#### Yamato Museum

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*E3npgh-TZU54G4E5JtN1jg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3TVr3YFnVBEnzbWIlTZ9Ng.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*mUYyUBQvTTx8mbQ2516W2w.jpeg)

Inside, there is a Yamato battleship that you can view up close from 360 degrees, with almost all details meticulously crafted. There are also exhibits on the history of battleships, wars, fighter planes, cannons, etc. It's a must-visit for battleship and military enthusiasts. Additionally, there was a special exhibition on Japanese aircraft carrier design and development history, including design manuscripts.

#### JMSDF Kure Museum

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*_G0SMX-74rgnIJtqQJWwvw.jpeg)

After leaving the Yamato Museum, walk towards the back to reach the JMSDF Kure Museum, which is free to enter.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*9BWAVAGIVbZ4va3NDMjo1A.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Wi-vcHvcF-4RqQosTduksQ.jpeg)

The museum mainly exhibits the living and working environments inside submarines, engines, mines, and history.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*44uKtTLacF4aXq6MPuFjhQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*u7Yog59KOjSAg0R2iWKHMg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qaRVV4LFdCmfMoNjsLFNjg.jpeg)

The most special part is that you can actually enter the submarine to visit the real engine room, dormitory, captain's room, cockpit, and use the periscope to view the external environment.

#### Kure City Shopping Street

After visiting the museums, it was almost noon, so I prepared to find something to eat. I originally planned to have navy curry, but after checking the reviews, it didn't seem particularly special. So, I decided to walk back to Kure City Shopping Street to make a decision. (It was actually quite far, in the opposite direction, and took about 30 minutes on foot.)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*08ryfbJs_lMZqiAkj7r_0Q.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*TuYPPoADttJ1zWk716UK8A.jpeg)

I finally chose to eat Kure cold noodles, which are similar to cold noodles with pork bone chashu. The noodles are chilled, the taste is refreshing, and the portion is quite large, so a small portion is enough.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*tvKWEChMpB9c1qyPqqsb0g.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-mgVYo5H_JjdmXhMbplH2Q.jpeg)

After eating, I prepared to return to the station. On the way, I also bought "Fukujyu Fried Red Bean Cake," which tasted quite sweet and oily, and was quite ordinary. Additionally, I bought navy coffee and curry as souvenirs ([subarucoffee_store/](https://www.instagram.com/subarucoffee_store/){:target="_blank"}, the staff were very friendly and enthusiastic).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*nDnjMo8kQAXiCy8iF6Fb1Q.jpeg)

Walk back to Wu Station and take the train back to Hiroshima.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*wUx4gtoAl8c7kBvhIXhe-w.jpeg)

After returning to Hiroshima, the final tour of Hiroshima city. There are three sightseeing bus routes available right outside Hiroshima Station (included in the JR Pass). You can choose the direction you want to go.

I wanted to go to Shukkeien (Hiroshima Museum of Art) first, so I chose to take the Red Maple Leaf bus.
#### Shukkeien

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*RIFGTX6ipG1G0uSlNsShcg.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*cPpsmj5ff-TNM4yEWxExvA.jpeg)

Shukkeien is right behind the Hiroshima Museum of Art. When buying tickets, you can also purchase a combined ticket for Shukkeien and the Hiroshima Museum of Art.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hEU5JheqeYqj8G06-RZyYQ.jpeg)

Shukkeien is a very exquisite small garden with many miniature landscapes inside, such as maple leaves, small bridges and flowing water, bamboo forests, pine and cypress trees, hills, etc. It's quite nice to walk around and enjoy the scenery.
#### Hiroshima Castle

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*yxTWLBwpKuf025kiuWemxw.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*uWLykJP2_3VnKtZWZATAzQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*biTmLBV6gM3lZjproKG_eg.jpeg)

The next stop is a stroll to Hiroshima Castle. Hiroshima Castle was destroyed in the atomic bombing. The current Hiroshima Castle is a reconstruction. It looks very new and is not very tall, so the view from the top is not particularly impressive.
#### Peace Memorial Museum, Peace Memorial Park

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*sHMbGZ-XOt7yBqxjpN2wcQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*goGSippywpI5vVhdK1WHOg.jpeg)

The final stop is a return to Peace Memorial Park. Right next to it is the Children's Peace Monument (not very tall, didn't go inside).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*-HqxYUWhkWiNWXnA20TtZg.jpeg)

Queued up to buy tickets to visit the Peace Memorial Museum. Inside, there is a wealth of information about the atomic bombing process, history, as well as photos and objects. The overall visit is very heavy and shocking.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*kRBjSbNgdK5pEgtpkQi2BQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*2FHg46ebTbABH0Yn8Ju4pg.jpeg)

On the other side of the park, there is a memorial hall. It felt too heavy, so I didn't go in.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*pl1v9-9TO7TXgaPC1wM0ew.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*Xq6dIYI1LNr6CQ0oLjvGkQ.jpeg)

In the evening, it started to drizzle, matching the somber mood after learning about the painful history. Returned to Hiroshima Station.

Casually bought some souvenirs and a bento at the station, then went back to the hotel to rest. Still need to do laundry today.

APA hotels are really everywhere. The president, president's curry, president's water, president's books...

The room density is as usual, with about 60 rooms per floor.

[![APA Hotel Hiroshima Station Front Ohashi](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/f242_hqdefault.jpg "APA Hotel Hiroshima Station Front Ohashi")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDYgKi202Nw){:target="_blank"}

The room is still small but well-equipped, with convenient electronic facilities (you can see the laundry room status from the room, and the TV can directly Airplay).

Had a big problem doing laundry, long queues. There are only 7 washing machines for over 1000 rooms in the whole building. Finally, timed it right, went downstairs to queue when the washing machine was about to finish, and finished washing and drying clothes by around 11 PM (still not dry, continued drying in the room).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*l9tc-BUxZYX-TmlcUxuwAQ.jpeg)

Staying up this late, having a midnight snack is very reasonable! Still Y1000 + milk + convenience store food.

### Day 5 Kurashiki, Okayama

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*hA2HBH2yrYFtbK7CjJ7AxQ.jpeg)

A beautiful morning with clear weather; checked out of the hotel, said goodbye to Hiroshima, and headed to the hotel in Kurashiki to drop off luggage (can also drop off in Okayama, as you need to go through Okayama to get to Kurashiki).

#### Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter, Achi Shrine

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*VHEesTUE6wppy8ap6R0gDQ.jpeg)

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*qejzHASiMgjfpezApmZIeQ.jpeg)

First stop was Achi Shrine, located on higher ground with a bird's-eye view of the entire Kurashiki area. Very quiet with few people.

Achi Shrine is not large but is famous for its ema pavilion. If you draw a bad fortune slip, you can tie it under the corresponding zodiac animal head according to your zodiac sign. There is also a charm for good relationships [Hanamushubi](https://supertaste.tvbs.com.tw/asia/340177){:target="_blank"}:

The scenic area is not large, but it is very quiet and pleasant to stroll around. We couldn't experience the boat ride as the tickets were sold out that day, but walking around the nearby alleys was also very enjoyable.

For lunch, we had the famous curry set meal at [Miyake Shoten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qdRm9RU7wzMbC8VVA){:target="_blank"}, the rich curry paired with burdock strips was delicious.

After eating, we continued to stroll around. When we got tired, we went to have a fruit parfait at [Parlor Fruit Komachi](http://www.kurashiki-yoimachi.co.jp/yoimachi/parlor.html){:target="_blank"} (the specialty is that the staff wear Taisho era maid outfits). The Okayama Shine Muscat grapes and fruit ice cream were so sweet it was almost numbing.

For souvenirs, you can buy [GOHOBI](https://setouchifinder.com/tw/detail/10118){:target="_blank"} Kurashiki specialty collagen Okayama fruit jelly.

Accompanied by the sunset, we took the train back to Okayama Station. After exiting the station, we directly took the tram to the area around Okayama Castle.

The first stop was Okayama Korakuen. The night illumination was very romantic and beautiful.

On the way to see the night view at Okayama Castle next door, the combination of maple leaves and lights created a unique atmosphere.

For dinner, I conveniently had Ippudo Ramen nearby, then took a leisurely walk back to Okayama Station (the lights along the way were beautiful). Before heading back to Kurashiki, I had some time to browse Don Quijote, but there weren't many souvenirs. You have to go to Okayama Station or a department store to find souvenirs...

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*spjr7DRx25wkmWsIE5uweQ.jpeg)

By the time I returned to Kurashiki, it was already evening. The weather was cold, and people on the streets were hurrying home. The outlet behind Kurashiki Station was also closed.

I realized that this hotel doesn't have a 24-hour front desk. Luckily, I didn't come back too late! However, the room facilities are very complete, including a microwave, kettle, and glasses cleaning machine.

On the last night in Japan, I simply had convenience store chicken nuggets and Y1000, and bought an extra bottle of white peach strawberry milk for a late-night snack before falling asleep.

### Day 6 Okayama, Return Trip

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*1kyJvOpLI3ihAU6mMtHzQQ.jpeg)

Early in the morning, just as the day was breaking, I checked out and headed to Okayama.

> Planning to take the airport shuttle from Okayama to the airport. **Kurashiki also has direct shuttles to Okayama Airport, but they are less frequent ([see the official website for details](https://www.okayama-airport.org/tw/access/bus){:target="_blank"}).** Since I didn't finish exploring Okayama yesterday, I decided to head straight to Okayama and then return from there.

#### Kibitsu Shrine

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*U77ZXlz-x3-e-HtTLAWCeg.jpeg)

After getting off at the station, I headed straight to Kibitsu Shrine (about a 30-minute drive). After getting off the bus, it takes about a 15-minute walk to reach the shrine. There is a long, historic cypress corridor, along with ginkgo trees and historical buildings, making it a pleasant place to walk and pray.

There is also another shrine, Kibitsuhiko Shrine, on the other side of the mountain, which can be visited along the way. However, due to time constraints, I skipped it this time.

#### Okayama AEON

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*ckSyNw4EkKDtUODyWDHR2Q.jpeg)

After returning to Okayama Station, I went to the nearby AEON Mall to buy some souvenirs, stroll around, and have a lunch of tempura soba noodles. Then, I prepared to queue for the airport shuttle back to Okayama Airport.

> **There are many people queuing for the shuttle, but don't worry about not getting on the bus because additional trips will be arranged to ensure everyone gets to the airport.**

#### Okayama Momotaro Airport (OKJ)

The airport is a bit old and about the same size as Kumamoto Airport. By around 13:50, I had completed security checks, check-in, and immigration. There were almost 2 hours left until the flight at 15:25.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*3YCu2TUlMXp6W95RtQsGnQ.jpeg)

There are very few flights at the airport, so it's just the people on the same flight. It took less than 15 minutes to complete check-in and baggage drop. Interestingly, Okayama Airport is so small that the X-ray machine is placed in the airport lobby. After passing the X-ray, a seal is placed on the luggage, and then you go to check-in (if you open your luggage, you will be required to go through security again).

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*aIb2fL4eCvk4FsNldk2tSg.jpeg)

After dropping off my luggage, I wandered around the terminal (only 2 floors). There is an observation deck, a café, and a few restaurants where you can eat. When I got tired, I bought a white peach ice cream to eat.

![](/assets/31b9b3a63abc/1*AV0wiyIjyHbm4LJ4DO8QOQ.jpeg)

Security checks were also quick, but at Okayama Airport, if you are wearing boots, you have to take them off for security, which is a bit inconvenient.

The flight was delayed, and I waited in the departure lounge. Finally, the flight took off at 16:24 (almost an hour delay).

#### Episode

After the " [2023 Kyushu 10-Day Solo Trip](../d78e0b15a08a/) ", I felt an indescribable sense of loneliness in the last few days. One reason was being alone in a strange place, and the other was not speaking Japanese, so I hardly spoke for 10 days. That sense of loneliness is still fresh in my memory, so I didn't really want to go again. However, since I was about to start working and happened to get a super cheap ticket, I decided to go.

On the first day, when I was exchanging the JR Pass, I got stuck and happened to meet a group of Taiwanese people who were also stuck. We took turns trying and finally succeeded. Coincidentally, she was also going to Hiroshima, and I reminded her when she got stuck at the entrance. We both bought tickets for the next train, she bought a non-reserved seat, and we both wanted to go to the convenience store first. Coincidentally, we were in the same industry, so we had a lot to talk about. We both went alone, so we ended up teaming up and completing the same itinerary on the first day.

**He is Angie!** Unexpectedly, I went alone but returned with someone. 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♀️

> **Many of the itineraries, attractions, and time arrangements were provided by Angie. If I had gone alone, I might have wandered aimlessly or missed out, and then walked alone for 6 days.**

#### Recommendation

Finally, I highly recommend the [Allite A1 65W GaN Fast Charger + Allite Liquid Silicone Fast Charging Cable](https://reurl.cc/67LEer){:target="_blank"} as a must-have travel gadget. The charger is compact, powerful, and fast, and the charging cable is long, easy to store, and doesn't bend or break like regular cables.
