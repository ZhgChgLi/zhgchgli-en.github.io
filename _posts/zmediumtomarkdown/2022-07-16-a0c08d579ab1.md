### Painless Migration from Medium to Self-Hosted Website

Migrating Medium content to Github Pages \(with Jekyll/Chirpy\)

### Background

In the fourth year of running Medium, I have accumulated over 65 articles, nearly 1000\+ hours of effort; the reason I chose Medium initially was its simplicity and convenience, allowing me to focus on writing without worrying about other things. Before that, I had tried self-hosting Wordpress, but I spent all my time on setting up the environment, styles, and plugins, never feeling satisfied with the adjustments. After setting it up, I found it loaded too slowly, the reading experience was poor, and the backend writing interface was not user-friendly, so I stopped updating it.

As I wrote more articles on Medium and accumulated some traffic and followers, I started wanting to control these achievements myself, rather than being controlled by a third-party platform \(e\.g Medium shutting down and losing all my work\). So, I began looking for a second backup website two years ago. I continued to run Medium but also synchronized the content to a website I could control. The solution I found at the time was — [Google Site](../724a7fb9a364/), but honestly, it could only be used as a personal "portal site." The article writing interface was limited in functionality, and I couldn't really transfer all my work there.

In the end, I returned to self-hosting, but this time using a static website instead of a dynamic one \(e\.g\. Wordpress\). Static websites support fewer features, but all I needed was a writing function and a clean, smooth, customizable browsing experience, nothing else!

The workflow for a static website is: write the article locally in Markdown format, then convert it to a static webpage using a static site engine and upload it to the server, and it's done. Static webpages provide a fast browsing experience!

Writing in Markdown format allows the article to be compatible with more platforms. If you're not used to it, you can find online or offline Markdown writing tools, and the experience is just like writing directly on Medium!

In summary, this solution meets my needs for a smooth browsing experience and a convenient writing interface.

### Install Ruby

Here, I will use my environment as an example. For other operating system versions, please [Google how to install Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/){:target="_blank"}.
- macOS Monterey 12.1
- rbenv
- ruby 2.6.5

#### Install [Brew](https://brew.sh/index_zh-tw){:target="_blank"}
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Brew.
#### Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"}
```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Although MacOS comes with Ruby, it is recommended to use rbenv to install another Ruby to separate it from the system's built-in version. Enter the above command in Terminal to install rbenv.
```bash
rbenv init
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to initialize rbenv.
- **Close & reopen Terminal.**

Enter `rbenv` in Terminal to check if the installation was successful!

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*uVcwZLxSUZymjxILlXyNcw.png)

**Success!**
#### Use rbenv to install Ruby
```bash
rbenv install 2.6.5
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Ruby version 2.6.5.
```bash
rbenv global 2.6.5
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to switch the Ruby version used by Terminal from the system's built-in version to the rbenv version.

Enter `rbenv versions` in Terminal to check the current settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*AJXLDusJQ7XJQjWHQOqWGA.png)

Enter `ruby -v` in Terminal to check the current Ruby version, and `gem -v` to check the current RubyGems status:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ANyW3uysaKSiySTDGi28gw.png)

> \*After installing Ruby, [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems){:target="_blank"} should also be installed.

**Success!**
#### Install Jekyll & Bundler & ZMediumToMarkdown
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler ZMediumToMarkdown
```

Enter the above command in Terminal to install Jekyll & Bundler & ZMediumToMarkdown.

**Done!**
### Create Jekyll Blog from Template

The default Jekyll Blog style is very simple. We can find and apply our favorite styles from the following websites:
- [GitHub.com \#jekyll-theme repos](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme){:target="_blank"}
- [jamstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io/){:target="_blank"}
- [jekyll-themes.com](https://jekyll-themes.com/){:target="_blank"}

The installation method generally uses [gem-based themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#installing-a-theme){:target="_blank"}, some repos provide a Fork method for installation, and some even offer a one-click installation method. In short, the installation method may vary for each template, so please refer to the template's tutorial for usage.

> Additionally, note that since we are deploying to Github Pages, according to the official documentation, not all templates are applicable.

### Chirpy Template

Here, I will use the template [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/){:target="_blank"} as an example, which I adopted for my Blog. This template provides the simplest one-click installation method and can be used directly.

> Other templates rarely offer similar one-click installation. If you are not familiar with Jekyll or GitHub Pages, using this template is a better way to get started. I will update the article with other template installation methods in the future.

> Additionally, you can find templates on GitHub that can be directly forked (e.g., [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio){:target="_blank"}) and used directly. If not, you will need to manually install the template and research how to set up GitHub Pages deployment. I tried this briefly but was not successful. I will update the article with my findings in the future.

#### Create Git Repo from Git Template

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*XRaln4SJiK-la32HhSYPug.png)

[https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate){:target="_blank"}
- Repository name: `GithubUsername/OrganizationName.github.io` (**Make sure to use this format**)
- Make sure to select "Public" for the Repo

Click "Create repository from template"

Complete the Repo creation.
#### Git Clone Project

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*cQUPBm6tzyceXV-iwY5rzw.png)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zhgchgli0718/zhgchgli0718.github.io.git
```

Git clone the newly created Repo.

Run `bundle` to install dependencies:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*4ebE2NABGtRbKvc75e6aLA.png)

Run `bundle lock — add-platform x86_64-linux` to lock the version

> ⚠️ \_config\.yml needs to be restarted after any adjustments to apply the changes.

#### Preview the Website

After the dependencies are installed,

you can start the local website with `bundle exec jekyll s`:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*f9xi6k6NCjesF0YtgjvogQ.png)

Copy the URL `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` and paste it into your browser to open it.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*BSUbXFi082ZkHil2cWV2BQ.png)

**Local preview successful!**

As long as this Terminal is open, the local website will be running. The Terminal will continuously update the website access logs, which is convenient for debugging.

We can open a new Terminal for other subsequent operations.
### Jekyll Directory Structure

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*Rf8A-Y36J1oy6rwG1Crt8w.png)

Depending on the template, there may be different folders and configuration files. The article directory is:
- **\_posts/**: Articles will be placed in this directory
Article file naming convention: `YYYY` – `MM` – `DD` \- `article-file-name` \.md
- **assets/**:
Website resource directory, images used on the website or **images within articles** should be placed here

Other directories like \_includes, \_layouts, \_sites, \_tabs… allow you to make advanced customizations.

Jekyll uses [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/){:target="_blank"} as the page template engine. The page template is composed in a manner similar to inheritance:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*g9n4qBgEWb_ErOOwqrUC6Q.jpeg)

Users can freely customize pages. The engine will first check if the user has created a corresponding custom file for the page -> if not, it will check if the template has one -> if not, it will use the original Jekyll style.

So we can easily customize any page by creating a file with the same name in the corresponding directory!
### Create/Edit Articles
- We can first delete all the sample article files under the `_posts/` directory.

Use [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} (free) or [Typora](https://typora.io/){:target="_blank"} (paid) to create Markdown files. Here we use [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} as an example:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*5xgNYYYQXHylU6GV_akGfQ.png)

- Article file naming convention: `YYYY` – `MM` – `DD` \- `article-file-name` \.md
- It is recommended to use English for the file name (SEO optimization), as this name will be the URL path

Article **Content Top Meta**:
```markdown
---
layout: post
title:  "Hello"

> ⚠️ Adjusting the article does not require restarting the website. The file changes will be rendered and displayed directly. If the modified content does not appear after a while, it may be due to an error in the article format causing rendering failure. You can check the Terminal for the reason.

### Download articles from Medium and convert them to Markdown for Jekyll

With basic knowledge of Jekyll, we move forward by using the [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} tool to download existing articles from Medium and convert them to Markdown format to place in our Blog folder.

[![](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/493527574/9b5b7025-cc95-4e81-84a9-b38706093c27)](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}

cd to the blog directory and run the following command to download all articles from the specified Medium user:
```bash
ZMediumToMarkdown -j your Medium account
```

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*cOFDZUWbpslzO975nT1QAg.png)

Wait for all articles to download...

> If you encounter any download issues or unexpected errors, feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"}. This downloader was written by me ([development insights](../ddd88a84e177/)), and I can help you solve the problem quickly and directly.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*5UfA22gZLQBXSc5jXgCmlg.png)

After the download is complete, you can preview the results on the local website.

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*1Qg8jGrPc5tDRI4tZ1B5dg.png)

**Done!! We have seamlessly imported Medium articles into Jekyll!**

You can check if the articles are formatted correctly and if there are any missing images. If there are any issues, feel free to [report them to me](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} for assistance in fixing them.

### Upload content to Repo

After confirming that the local preview content is correct, we need to push the content to the Github Repo.

Use the following Git commands in sequence:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update post"
git push
```

After pushing, go back to Github, and you will see that Actions are running CD:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*UV9_80VRsMvmLtYJVpTrog.png)

Wait about 5 minutes...

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ZvVHhaIcZjUZgvtUkFte5w.png)

Deployment completed!

#### Initial deployment settings

After the initial deployment, you need to change the following settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*enRTr0wapljkC7pi-qJ91g.png)

Otherwise, when you visit the website, you will only see:
```
--- layout: home # Index page ---
```

After clicking "Save," it will not take effect immediately. You need to go back to the "Actions" page and wait for the deployment again.

After redeployment is complete, you can successfully access the website:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*YvIOSgW9sQ14UIWUMFTJww.png)

Demo -> [zhgchg.li](https://zhgchg.li/){:target="_blank"}

Now you also have a free Jekyll personal blog!!

#### About deployment

Every time you push content to the Repo, it will trigger a redeployment. You need to wait for the deployment to succeed for the changes to take effect.

### Bind a custom domain

If you don't like the [zhgchgli0718.github.io](https://zhgchgli0718.github.io/){:target="_blank"} Github URL, you can purchase a domain you like from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/P0jdZQ){:target="_blank"} or register a free .tk domain from [Dot.tk](http://dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en){:target="_blank"}.

After purchasing the domain, go to the domain backend:

Add the following four Type A Record records
```
A Record @ 185.199.108.153
A Record @ 185.199.109.153
A Record @ 185.199.110.153
A Record @ 185.199.111.153
```

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*29e7AxJnZpnrNbniRMtkKg.png)

After adding the settings in the domain backend, go back to Github Repo Settings:

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*Q-FB7x5j9t-Q6QKW6LFTow.png)

In the Custom domain section, enter your domain, and then click "Save".

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*ZlXEv-g-W58sbe7lfnT1kQ.png)

After the DNS is connected, you can replace the original github.io address with zhgchg\.li.

> ⚠️ DNS settings take at least 5 minutes ~ 72 hours to take effect. If it cannot be verified, please try again later.

### Cloud, Fully Automated Medium Synchronization Mechanism

Every time there is a new article, you have to manually run [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} on your computer and then push it to the project. Is it troublesome?

[ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} actually also provides a convenient [Github Action feature](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/zmediumtomarkdown-automatic-bot){:target="_blank"} that allows you to free up your computer and automatically synchronize Medium articles to your website.

**Go to the Actions settings of the Repo:**

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*DioRzBToaaSmYzccOrCwBw.png)

Click "New workflow"

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*jGkqhcqk-H7_cCWWZwVNzg.png)

Click "set up a workflow yourself"

![](/assets/a0c08d579ab1/1*vA7YX2umOfis2pSUxlR60Q.png)

- Change the file name to: `ZMediumToMarkdown.yml`
- The file content is as follows:

```yaml
name: ZMediumToMarkdown
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "10 1 15 * *" # At 01:10 on day-of-month 15.

jobs:
  ZMediumToMarkdown:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: ZMediumToMarkdown Automatic Bot
      uses: ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown@main
      with:
        command: '-j your Medium account'
```
- [cron](https://crontab.guru/){:target="_blank"}: Set the execution cycle (weekly? monthly? daily?). Here it is set to automatically execute at 1:15 AM on the 15th of each month.

After running, it will trigger a redeployment. Once the redeployment is complete, the latest content will appear on the website. 🚀

> No manual operation required! This means you can continue to update Medium articles in the future, and the script will automatically help you sync the content from the cloud to your own website!
