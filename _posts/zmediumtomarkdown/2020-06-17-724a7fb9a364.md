### Is it Still Up-to-Date to Build a Personal Website Using Google Site?

New Google Site Personal Website Building Experience and Setup Tutorial



![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*XFmZ3hHYo2X0GqM9OReN7A.png)

### Update 2022â€“07â€“17

Currently, I have used my self-written [ZMediumToMarkdown](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZMediumToMarkdown){:target="_blank"} tool to package and download Medium articles and convert them to Markdown format, migrating to Jekyll.

#### ===
### Origin

Last year, when I changed jobs, I "extravagantly" registered a [domain name](http://www.zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"} to serve as a personal resume link; after half a year, I thought of making the domain more useful by adding more information. On the other hand, I was also looking for a second website to back up the articles published on Medium, just in case.
### Desired Features
- Customizable pages
- Smooth writing interface like Medium
- Interactive features (like/comment/follow)
- Good SEO structure
- Lightweight and fast loading
- Ability to bind to own domain
- Low intrusiveness (ad intrusiveness, site branding)
- Easy to set up

### Site Options
1. **Self-hosted WordPress** 
A long time ago, I rented a host and domain and used WordPress to build a personal website; from setup to adjusting to my preferred layout, installing plugins, and even developing missing plugins myself, I had no energy left to write. Moreover, it felt cumbersome, and the loading speed/SEO was not as good as Medium. Spending more time fine-tuning it would leave me with even less energy to write.
2. **Matters/Jianshu, etc.** 
Similar to the Medium platform, but since I'm not considering monetization, it's not suitable.
3. wix/weebly are too commercial-oriented, and the free version is too intrusive
4. **Google Site (this article)**
5. Github Pages + Jekyll
6. **Still looking >>> Suggestions are welcome**

### About Google Site

Around 2010, I used the old version of Google Site to create a personal website -> file download center page; the impression is a bit vague, but I remember the layout was cumbersome, and the interface was not smooth. After 10 years, I thought this service had been discontinued. I accidentally saw a domain investor using it to create a domain parking page with contact information for sale:

At first glance, I thought, "Wow! The visuals are nice, they even made a page to sell the domain." Upon closer inspection of the bottom left corner, I realized, "Wow! It's built with Google Site," which is vastly different from the interface I used 10 years ago. After checking, I found out that Google Site had not been discontinued; instead, a new version was launched in 2016. Although it's been almost five years since then, at least the interface is up-to-date!
### Finished Product Showcase

Before saying anything else, let's take a look at the finished product I made. If you also "feel the same," you might consider giving it a try!

### Why Not Give It a Try?

To save reading time, I'll **get straight to the point; I'm still looking for a more suitable service option**. Although it is continuously maintained and updated, Google Site has several critical shortcomings that are important to me. Here are the fatal flaws I encountered while using it.
#### Fatal Flaws
1. **Code Highlighting Function Defect** 
The function only shows `Code Block with gray background` without color changes. If you want to embed Gist, you can only use Embed JavaScript (iframe), but Google Site does not handle it well. The height cannot change with page scaling, resulting in either too much blank space or two scroll bars on small mobile screens, which is very ugly and hard to read.
2. **SEO Structure is Basically Zero** 
"Surprised? Not really." Google's own service has an SEO structure like ðŸ’©. It doesn't allow customization of any head meta (description/tag/og:). Forget about SEO ranking; just pasting your site link on Line/Facebook and having no preview information, only an ugly URL and site name, is already bad enough.



![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*J3_xIg5gj218xWci44_fMg.png)

#### Advantages

**1. Low Intrusiveness, only a floating exclamation mark at the bottom left that shows "Google Collaboration Platform Report Abuse" when clicked**


![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*G613lcXGZJyoH_4Yh0uDVw.gif)


**2. Easy-to-use Interface, quickly create pages by dragging components on the right**


![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*tL8eMmBU50Ve-ReHjdlNOA.png)


Similar to wix/weebly or cakeresume? Just drag and fill in the components to complete the layout!

**3. Supports RWD, built-in search, navigation bar**

**4. Supports Landing Page**


![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*rFFL-Z9wsj9hyTXlf12fYQ.gif)


**5. No special traffic limits, capacity depends on the creator's Google Drive limit**

**6.** ðŸŒŸ **Can bind to your own domain**

**7.** ðŸŒŸ **Can directly integrate GA for visitor analysis**

**8. [Official Community](https://support.google.com/sites/threads?hl=en){:target="_blank"} collects feedback and continuously maintains updates**

**9. Supports announcement notifications**


![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*VSocV0KGjORCT2te5BPcdg.png)


**10.** ðŸŒŸ **Seamlessly embeds YouTube, Google Forms, Google Slides, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Maps, and supports RWD for desktop/mobile browsing**

**11.** ðŸŒŸ **Page content supports JavaScript/Html/CSS embedding**

**12. Clean and simple URLs (http://example.com/page-name/subpage-name), customizable page path names**

**13\.** ðŸŒŸ **Page layout has reference lines/auto-alignment, very considerate**

### Applicable Websites

I think Google Site is only suitable for very lightweight web services, such as school clubs, small event websites, personal resumes.
### Some Setup Tutorials

List some problems I encountered and solved during use; everything else is WYSIWYG operations, nothing much to record.
#### How to bind a personal domain?

**1\.** Go to [http://google.com/webmasters/verification](http://google.com/webmasters/verification){:target="_blank"} 
**2\.** Click " **Add a property** " and enter " **Your domain** " then click **"Continue"**


![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*2Df1gSYTKGc4gFPKXCL8LA.png)


**3\.** Choose your " **Domain name provider** " and copy the " **DNS verification string** "


![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*qwfeg8KpI5q52AgB6KoMaQ.png)


**4\. Go to your domain name provider's website** \(Here we use Namecheap.com as an example, others are similar\)


![](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*akLlYe8eoGu2oh97eqyiEg.png)


In the DNS settings section, add a new record, select " **TXT Record** " as the type, enter " **@** " as the host, and enter the **DNS verification string you just copied** as the value, then click add to submit.

Add another record, select " **CNAME Record** " as the type, enter " **www (or the subdomain you want to use)** " as the host, and enter " **ghs.googlehosted.com.** " as the value, then click add to submit.


> _Additionally, you can also redirect [http://zhgchg.li](http://zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"} -> [http://www.zhgchg.li](http://www.zhgchg.li){:target="_blank"}_ 





> _After setting this up, you need to wait a bit... waiting for the DNS records to take effect..._ 





**5\. Go back to Google Master and click verify**


> _If you see **"Verification failed"** don't worry! Please wait a bit longer, if it still doesn't work after an hour, go back and check if there are any mistakes in the settings._

Gist as an example

> _But as mentioned in the fatal flaw above, embedding an iframe cannot respond to the height according to the webpage size._

**How to insert?**

![Select "Embed"](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*DNUUlzli89PNnVr519tJww.png)

Select "Embed"

![Choose embed code](/assets/724a7fb9a364/1*HQjsXL1VpMkA3OLDiAgNFA.png)

Choose embed code

You can enter JavaScript/HTML/CSS to create custom styled Button UI.

> **_Additionally, selecting "Image" allows you to insert multiple images, which will be displayed in a waterfall flow (as seen on my [City Corner](https://www.zhgchg.li/photo){:target="_blank"} page)._**

#### Embedded Google Forms cannot be filled out directly on the page?

This is because the form contains a " **file upload** " item, [which cannot be embedded in other pages using an iframe due to browser security issues](https://support.google.com/sites/thread/24853300?hl=en){:target="_blank"}; thus, it only shows the survey information and requires clicking the fill button to open a new window to complete the form.

The solution is to remove the file upload item, allowing the form to be filled out directly on the page.

### **Button component URLs cannot include anchor points**

EX: \#lifesection, I want to place it at the top of the page for a table of contents or at the bottom for a GoTop button.

According to the official community, this is currently not possible. The button link can only 1. open an external link in a new window or 2. specify an internal page. Therefore, I later used subpages to split the directory.
