[ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"}

[ZReviewsBot](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewsBot){:target="_blank"} is a free, open-source project that helps your app team automatically track the latest reviews of apps on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) platforms and send them to a designated Slack Channel for you to understand the current app status in real-time.
- ✅ Uses updated, more reliable API Endpoint to track iOS app reviews ([Technical Details](../cb0c68c33994/))
- ✅ Supports dual-platform review tracking for iOS & Android
- ✅ Supports keyword notification skip feature (to avoid spam ads)
- ✅ Customizable settings, as you wish
- ✅ Supports deployment of Schedule Auto Bot using Github Action

### \[2022/07/20 Update\]

[App Store Connect API now supports reading and managing Customer Reviews](../f1365e51902c/), this bot will implement this in future updates, replacing the method of using Fastlane — Spaceship to fetch reviews from the backend.
### Origin

Following the previous article " [AppStore APP’s Reviews Slack Bot](../cb0c68c33994/) ", I researched and completed a new iOS review fetching tool. I thought it might be suitable as a Side Project Open Source for friends with the same problem.
