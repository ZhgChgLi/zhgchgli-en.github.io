### \[Travelogue\] 9/11 Nagoya One-Day Flash Free Travel

Peach Aviation Nagoya One-Day Flash Ticket Travel Experience

### Background

A round-trip ticket for a day trip to Nagoya is an activity launched by Peach Aviation:

[![](https://www.flypeach.com/application/files/8414/6219/0687/peach_tailwing.png)](https://www.flypeach.com/tw/um/specials/int_shorttrip){:target="_blank"}

I bought a round-trip ticket to Nagoya with airport service fee included for `$5,600` at that time, **no checked baggage, no meals, no assigned seats**; both flights were red-eye flights:
- Outbound: TPE 02:25 \-&gt; NGO 06:30
- Return: NGO 23:15 \-&gt; TPE 01:25

According to official promotional materials, **the longest stay is 16 hours and 45 minutes**!

Carry-on baggage regulations: **Two pieces per person & total weight less than 7 kilograms**

#### Visit Japan

To speed up entry, I filled out the entry information in advance and completed the entry procedures directly using a QR code:

[![](https://services.digital.go.jp/ogp.png)](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/zh-hant/){:target="_blank"}

- I filled in a 1-day stay here, and for the contact information in Japan, I directly filled in the information for Chubu Centrair International Airport, without being asked, and passed through safely!

### KKday Promotion
- Nagoya area transportation tickets, one-stop purchase for experiences: "[**Nagoya Chubu International Airport NGO ⇆ Nagoya Station\|Meitetsu Airport Express Train E-Ticket, LegoLand, Japan sim/eSim card, Ghibli Park**](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/city/nagoya?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"}"

### Conclusion \(written at the beginning\)

A one-day flash is a test of physical and mental endurance; I originally planned to wait at the airport or sleep on the plane, but I wasn't sleepy because the waiting time at the airport was too early. After boarding the plane, the seat was too small, not by the window, the engine noise was very loud, and I didn't really fall asleep, so it was like not sleeping all night; I started the Nagoya itinerary at 6:00 after getting off the plane; I was so tired that I slept for over half an hour in a quiet cafe at Nagoya Tower at noon \(quiet, not many people\).

Time and attractions are limited, so I couldn't go too far.

In addition to the body's energy, the phone's battery is also a big test; I brought a 20,000 mAh Xiaomi power bank to complete the entire itinerary \(probably charged the iPhone 13 back and forth 4–5 times\).

I returned to Taiwan around 2–3 am, with no public transportation, so I had to take a taxi back to Taipei.

You can pay a few hundred more to choose a window seat, prepare a neck pillow, and earplugs for better sleep.
### Departure
#### 9/10 PM 22:03 — Arrive at Taoyuan Airport MRT A1 Taipei Main Station, take the 22:15 direct train to Terminal 1

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*dnSVLmlJGYdrhTGIIszerQ.png)

#### 9/10 PM 10:55 — Arrive at Terminal 1 Departure Hall

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*hqBq_mPwADgJVgiyTySVJA.png)

Arrived too early, the check-in counter opened at 23:55 (although I didn't have checked baggage, I couldn't check in online for some reason, so I had to wait for the counter to open).

Still an hour before check-in opened, so I went back to the B1 food street to find a place to rest; all the shops in the food street were closed at 11 PM (including convenience stores), couldn't find anything to eat.
#### 9/11 AM 00:09 — Completed departure

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*hgsHsAqRPmS42NW3Lvt0_Q.png)

The check-in counter opened early, I returned to the departure hall at 11:40 and saw that check-in had started; without checked baggage, just carrying a backpack, quickly completed check-in & security check & departure.

Starting from 9/11, officially counting down 24 hours!
#### 9/11 AM 00:12 — Wandering in Terminal 1

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*tT0HjtgmHi38ys5yK6j3TQ.jpeg)

It's worth mentioning that there is a free lounge in Terminal 1, just follow the signs to the VIP lounge; the environment and seats are similar to a cafe, there is even a shower room (open from 6 AM to 10 PM); for more details, refer to [this article](https://stancy.tw/airport-lounge/){:target="_blank"}.

It's actually better to sleep in the lounge area because you can lie down... But at that time, I just took a quick look and started looking for a place to buy food at the airport (because there was no in-flight meal), but it was late and everything was closed, I only found a vending machine selling cookies, so I bought a pack of Yimei cream puffs and a can of tea.
#### 9/11 AM 00:45 — Waiting at the boarding gate

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*bUf08uTaKk9ecZZShKP1fA.png)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*LAFV5rJcrW9aq2HcOL7xcw.png)

Arrived really early, not many people in the boarding gate area; the chairs are in pairs, making it difficult to lie down and sleep (very uncomfortable, I got up after taking the photo), sleeping with your head up is also uncomfortable, and the boarding gate area is very cold; but at that time, I was still feeling okay, not sleepy, as time passed, more people arrived, it got noisier, making it even harder to sleep; so I just closed my eyes to rest and conserve energy, reviewed some basic Japanese (hiragana), planning to sleep on the plane later.
#### 9/11 AM 02:14 — Completed boarding

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*urxHjZKt6pP7cZlJSYE7fw.png)

The flight was slightly delayed, boarding was supposed to start at 01:55, delayed by 10 minutes; I completed boarding at 02:15.
#### 9/11 AM 02:26 — Flight takeoff

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*utaf6ccP3yAzTMWB0YbN_A.jpeg)

The seat was very small, no headrest by the aisle, luckily I had a neck pillow for some support, but the noise of the engines and neck discomfort made it almost impossible to sleep, so I endured the bumpy ride all the way to Nagoya; there was no screen displaying the flight distance on the plane, making the time feel very long.

> If I had to choose again, I would pay a little extra for a window seat; one, there's a better place to rest your head, and two, you can see the sunrise from the window when arriving in Japan in the morning!!

#### 9/11 AM 06:20 — Arrived at Chubu Centrair International Airport, Nagoya

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*prYbU60HuhHIVpPm0kvszw.png)

#### 9/11 AM 06:35 — Completed immigration

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BqtD5pBEWJrLAM5JaD4lDg.jpeg)

Perhaps due to the early morning and no need to pick up luggage, it took less than 15 minutes from landing to immigration; but the weather wasn't great, it was raining heavily in Nagoya.
#### 9/11 AM 7:03 — Waiting for the shuttle to Nagoya city

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*J85ZhklkjVsbi8NVG6Y8uA.jpeg)

> [_KKday Chubu Centrair International Airport NGO ⇆ Nagoya Station | Meitetsu Airport Express Train e-Ticket_](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/20418-chubu-centrair-international-airport-express-train-transfer-to-nagoya?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"}

I first bought a one-way train ticket from Chubu Centrair International Airport to Nagoya + uSky train ($271) online, thinking since I'm here, might as well experience the newest and best train; assigned seats, very stable and comfortable, and it's an express train.

However, if you want to save money and convenience, you can actually buy tickets on-site or take a regular train directly to the station; attach the train schedule and stops, or directly search from [Meitetsu website](https://trainbus.meitetsu.co.jp/meitetsu-transfer-en/pc/map/Top){:target="_blank"}:

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*9UM0s_DJ8p9S4Rijxcno_w.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Yu_6S8qQnLUfOlmByzWb_w.jpeg)

#### 1st Destination: [Konparu Osu コンパル Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZuXeeyb527htfdc17){:target="_blank"} - Try the Fried Shrimp Toast

You need to get off at Kanayama (NH34) and transfer to "Meijo Line" to go to Kamiiida Station.
#### Arrive at [Konparu Osu コンパル Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZuXeeyb527htfdc17){:target="_blank"} at 8:00 AM on 9/11

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BEhfcQEMNhmKAEICAAl-oQ.jpeg)

The store opens at 8:00, but there were no people around early in the morning, and the nearby Osu shopping street was not open yet.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*fvZ_c7ZSFzEq_5weXS3S-A.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*_bj9uvgvGuOyquI7sBCToQ.jpeg)

Coffee is a must, especially after staying up all night; the shrimp in the fried shrimp toast is cut into pieces, giving a chewy texture.
#### 2nd Destination: [Nagoya Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UrJUoP5CSaXT9PBPA){:target="_blank"}

Nagoya Castle opens at 9:00, other attractions don't open that early, and it's on the way from Kamiiida Station, so I decided to visit Nagoya Castle first.
#### Arrive at [Nagoya Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UrJUoP5CSaXT9PBPA){:target="_blank"} at 9:02 AM on 9/11

After having breakfast, I arrived at Nagoya Castle Station around 9:02.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*ARhQGgrg3FGmc9H78qhnZA.jpeg)

Upon exiting the station, I found it was raining heavily outside, and I didn't expect rain in Japan, so I didn't bring an umbrella; there were no convenience stores nearby, but I finally found a FamilyMart in the underground street at Nagoya Castle Station B1, bought an umbrella, and continued to Nagoya Castle.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*p8s-2KUc357TIu83Q8DzHw.jpeg)

As I entered Nagoya Castle, the rain eased a bit, but the main keep was under maintenance and not open to visitors, so I only visited the splendid Honmaru Palace next to it.

![Honmaru Palace](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*s6ReFycKcyd06J9DqWOL6Q.jpeg)

To enter the Honmaru Palace, you need to take off your shoes and store your bag (free, but you need a ¥100 coin).
#### 2nd Destination: [Chubu Electric Power MIRAI TOWER (formerly Nagoya TV Tower)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8eHMMb6MJ4fxZY3u9){:target="_blank"}

Located at the lower right corner of Nagoya Castle, about 2 stops away; I took a bus after leaving Nagoya Castle.
#### Arrive at [Chubu Electric Power MIRAI TOWER (formerly Nagoya TV Tower)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8eHMMb6MJ4fxZY3u9){:target="_blank"} at 10:08 AM on 9/11

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*jBdGgsT8a4JR3gxGP0VVDA.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*QLSn1QzIhtBhm10LyjQNbA.jpeg)

The weather was cloudy with occasional sunshine when I arrived, then it cleared up, and it became cloudy again when I left.

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Zbvx-RhT1QcaOYsgkrROFg.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*j_Ovwa7Q9xob5m-Vo1Zt7A.jpeg)

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*siU1IitFVrI6Dsyp1dZhNw.jpeg)

After buying a ticket, you can go up to the observation deck to overlook Nagoya City (if you only want to visit the middle-level café, no ticket is needed, and you can still enjoy some views).

![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*WK28lGWl7B0HzdDbfk92cw.jpeg)


Café view, feeling sleepy around 10:30; slept here until after 11, lots of seats, few people, quiet... perfect for a nap.
#### 3rd destination: [Oasis 21](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6TM1nshDh3kupwRa6){:target="_blank"}

Oasis 21 is just outside Nagoya Tower, but not much to see due to rain + weekday + morning, so just took a quick look around and left.
#### 4th destination: [Yabaton Yabacho Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/91JsWCJPoW2YtjVE8){:target="_blank"}

Approaching noon, wanted to try Nagoya's famous miso pork cutlet, the store is about one or two stops away from Nagoya Tower, decided to walk there.
#### 5th destination: [Osukannon Shopping Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ErxDxS57PC1g6qyH9){:target="_blank"}

Arrived to find a long line due to the crowd... time was precious, since near Osu Shopping Street, continued walking there to find food.
#### 9/11 PM 12:09 — Arrived at [Osukannon Shopping Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ErxDxS57PC1g6qyH9){:target="_blank"}


Walking towards Osu Kannon, just before Osu Kannon there is another branch of [Shichijo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HaHhChfzKLmvZaoBA){:target="_blank"}, went in for a meal.
 

Mindlessly ordered a set meal, realized I ordered wrong, mainly wanted to eat the miso pork cutlet in the top left corner, set meal includes miso pork cutlet + fried willow leaf fish + tsukemono + side dish + soup + rice; miso pork cutlet was delicious but not enough!
#### 6th destination: [Osu Kannon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XepPPJRip3Tjk2ah6){:target="_blank"}

This store is right next to Osu Kannon.
#### 9/11 PM 13:05— Arrived at [Osu Kannon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XepPPJRip3Tjk2ah6){:target="_blank"}

Main hall under maintenance, just walked around outside and left.


Beware of birds, many pigeons outside, can buy feed to feed the pigeons.
#### 7th destination: [Atsuta Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VhuvdRMq2R59sted7){:target="_blank"}

Walked through Osu Shopping Street again, headed back to Meijo Line, towards Atsuta Shrine.

Bought a Benten fruit daifuku to eat on the way, thin and tender skin, plenty of fresh fruit juice, bought two at once! (I think it's tastier than Rokkakudo XD)


Went to a drugstore in the shopping street and bought some medicines that can be taken on the plane to bring back to Taiwan.
#### 9/11 PM 13:35 — Arrived at [Atsuta Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VhuvdRMq2R59sted7){:target="_blank"}


Exiting Atsuta Shrine Station on the Meijo Line, still a bit of a walk to reach the main gate of Atsuta Shrine for worship.


After a simple worship, bought some amulets and left.
#### 8th destination: [Meitetsu Nagoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZB2UMYgoLPqEeC8){:target="_blank"} Shopping Street

The last point is to visit Meitetsu \(actually very tired when arriving here\).
#### 9/11 PM 14:40 — Arrive at [Meitetsu Nagoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rZZB2UMYgoLPqEeC8){:target="_blank"}

After a stroll in the underground street, head towards JR GATE TOWER, go up to the [Starbucks on the 15th floor](https://www.bigfang.tw/blog/post/jrgatetower-starbucks-nagoya){:target="_blank"} where you can enjoy a free view.


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*BUk_IIz5Ug7QkVBihLnL0g.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*j4UgSts_BKlk-prXhkVwXg.jpeg)


Because the outdoor seats were not open due to rain, and the indoor seats were full, I didn't buy a cup of coffee to sit and rest while enjoying the view; took some photos and then started heading downstairs to Takashimaya Department Store, where there is a Harbs but requires queuing.

Across the street, there is a [Sky Promenade](https://journey.tw/sky-promenade/){:target="_blank"} in Nagoya, a new observation deck, but I didn't go because I was tired, needed to buy another ticket, and the weather was not good; by the time I checked if I could still go and the points of interest I was interested in were gone; in the end, I just continued strolling down to the underground street to buy some souvenirs \(Frog Hometown\); bought a one-way ticket from Nagoya Railway to Chubu Centrair International Airport + uSky train \($271\) and returned to the airport.

It was a bit of a shame that it wasn't even 5:00 PM yet... but going to other attractions again would be too far... and I wanted to avoid the crowd during rush hour.
#### 9th destination: Wander around Chubu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*x3BFbEYi64LsDqs8f3G7Jw.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*m_NhGgVYi2nlI27VbeHHug.jpeg)


Took a photo of the real uSky.
#### 9/11 PM 16:44 — Arrive at Chubu Centrair International Airport Terminal 1


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*3BROtCPC5xEFs-s2HEwpPQ.png)


The flight is not until 23:15, still a long time to go.


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*-kJWx09_h9L_VYTgiNaVKw.jpeg)


First, try the famous Tebasaki in Nagoya.

There are many things to see at NGO Airport, besides food and drinks inside, there is also a large observation deck where you can see planes take off and land up close! \(Terminal 1\)


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*567y9tbb7H1mGf6qeMyAlA.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*5jcf5tUyKWGEicHYE-fROg.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*IUpd954AOvd9TqJAIckFng.jpeg)


Or go to Terminal 2 first to see the free aircraft museum \(it was closed when I went\).


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*OBOPATQIn9zZWxikMYTzPg.jpeg)



![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*Y7_RLuAEPZMDzYFlLs8rJg.jpeg)


There is also a Lawson and a capsule toy store here \(but they also have operating hours\).
#### 9/11 PM 19:30 — Dinner at Chubu Centrair International Airport Terminal 1

Had dinner at the airport's [Nagoya Udon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cnZpXBh68FjYK39Y8){:target="_blank"}, Nagoya's specialty noodles are flat.


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*KP1z3qVdeNZAKZy_lb05Xg.jpeg)


The taste was good, but accidentally ordered two main dishes... their tonkatsu was tonkatsu rice XD

After eating, continue waiting for the flight... waiting for the counter to open \(opens at 20:45\).
#### 9/11 PM 20:45 — Departure procedures at Chubu Centrair International Airport Terminal 1


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*sSHi3yR-JN2qt4TUsZk-lw.png)


Glanced at the clock in the corner and went to queue for departure preparation around 20:00; the carry-on baggage check by the airline is quite strict, the rule is two pieces weighing less than 7 kilograms each, no turning a blind eye; saw someone simply going to buy a PS5 and come back, seemed like a good choice for a one-day flash target.
#### 9/11 PM 21:45 — Duty-free shopping and waiting at Chubu Centrair International Airport Terminal 1


![](/assets/7b8a0563c157/1*6Euv3ovejIlqA56pGJ8GRQ.jpeg)

I only have one bag, so I can carry another one. I happened to buy a bottle of Tanjirou 750 ml back to Taiwan. (5,700 yen, 100 yen more expensive than Tokyo)

Coca-Cola is delicious. If you see it in a supermarket or vending machine, you can buy it and try it out. It is a collaboration between Suntory and Pepsi, not available in Taiwan. It is made like draft beer but as a cola, very fizzy, not too syrupy. I usually end up pouring out regular cola because it's too sweet, but I can finish a Coca-Cola Life!

> Back at the United Airlines carry-on baggage check, they strictly check if you only have two items. If not, they will ask you to either make it two items on the spot or pay extra.

#### 9/12 AM 00:09 — Departure from Central International Airport Terminal 1

Due to flight delay, originally scheduled for 23:15, delayed to 23:50; took off around 00:15.

But luckily got a window seat, can have a good sleep.

Studied the onboard facilities after waking up, only then did I realize that flight information, entertainment videos can be viewed by connecting to onboard WiFi with a phone, and ordering can also be done directly with a phone.

Someone ordered something similar to spare ribs chicken noodles to eat, the whole cabin was filled with a delicious smell, very tempting.

#### 9/12 AM 02:25 — Arrived at Taoyuan International Airport

Fortunately, got some rest on the plane due to the window seat; feeling okay.

#### 9/12 AM 03:30 Arrived at the warm Taipei residence

Have to say that transportation in Taiwan is very inconvenient. Taking a red-eye flight to Taoyuan Airport, can only take a scary flat-rate taxi or expensive Uber back to Taipei; if you want to take public transportation, you can only wait for the 4-5 am shuttle.

### Purpose of this trip: To visit Nagoya Castle, one of the three famous cities:

Later found out that there is also [Inuyama Castle](https://www.kkday.com/zh-tw/product/177762?cid=19365&ud1=9da2c51fa4f2){:target="_blank"} in Nagoya, if rearranged, should go to Inuyama Castle first, and didn't get to eat eel rice!
