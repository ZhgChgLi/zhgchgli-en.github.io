### Easily Create a 'Fake' Transparent Perspective Wallpaper Using iPhone

Using iMovie's green screen keying feature to composite videos

### Anyway, I'm Bored

[Working during the day, exploited by capitalists; at night, exploited by mass entertainment, still unable to achieve the realm of working during the day, studying at night, and critiquing on holidays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_dVHQBx-4k){:target="_blank"}!

Recently, while mindlessly relaxing, **I came across a very common wallpaper app advertisement that showcased an eye-catching transparent perspective wallpaper**; but it's obviously impossible, even if the rear camera was capturing the scene in real-time, the angles wouldn't match so perfectly!

### Let's Be Smart Youth!

Although I knew it was a special effect, I thought it would be very complicated; unexpectedly, the built-in iMovie app on the iPhone can easily create it with a few taps.
#### **You only need:**
1. An iPhone (because we need to use iMovie directly), a phone for the scene
2. A phone or camera for shooting
3. A phone stand or a water bottle... or any object that can support the phone
4. [iMovie APP](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/imovie/id377298193){:target="_blank"} (free download)
5. A green background image (green screen)

These 5 items can create a perspective effect!
#### Specific process:
1. Set up the phone responsible for filming
2. Shoot a clean video (without the phone in the frame)
3. Set the background of the phone to be filmed as a green screen
4. Shoot a video of the phone operation
5. Open the iMovie APP to composite
6. Done

### Start
#### 1. Set up the phone and adjust the filming angle


![I used two eel cans and a bottle of mineral water as a phone stand (a vertical phone stand would be even better!)](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*-Y5H7G6VVPUUgTGaUB2f1A.jpeg)

I used two eel cans and a bottle of mineral water as a phone stand (a vertical phone stand would be even better!)

The purpose of using a phone stand is to ensure that the angles of the two videos are consistent. Otherwise, there will be a shift in the frame, and the effect won't look as good. It's impossible to hold the phone and have the angles of both videos be 100% the same.
#### 2. Shoot a clean video

Shoot the clean video as long as you want the final video to be.
#### 3. Set the background of the phone to be filmed as a green screen

Finished image
#### 4. Shoot a video of the phone operation

**The length of the video should be the same as the clean video; it's okay if it's longer, you can trim it later.**
#### 5. Open the iMovie APP to create a project

![“+” -> “Movie” -> Select “Clean Video” -> “Create Movie”](/assets/2e4429f410d6/1*Ju3cpubikU57M0fRadT_FA.jpeg)

“+” -> “Movie” -> Select “Clean Video” -> “Create Movie”

Insert the clean video into the project.
#### 6. Move the playhead to the beginning

If you don't move the playhead to the beginning of the clean video, you will see the message “Move the playhead away from the end to add overlay” when inserting the green screen video.
#### 7. Insert the phone operation video

### Tips
1. You can first hide apps with green icons, such as Line, Messages... to prevent exposure (because the keying is based on green)
2. Or you can use a blue background and key out blue; other colors can also be used (but green/blue works best)
3. There are more ways to play with this principle, waiting for you to discover!

### Conclusion

Just for fun... I didn't expect iMovie to be so powerful!
