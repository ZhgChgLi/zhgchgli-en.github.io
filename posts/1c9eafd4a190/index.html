the knowledge about management is only gathered from previous work experience, observations, or casual chats with colleagues, knowing what actions taken by a supervisor are viewed positively or negatively by subordinates. These experiences and thoughts are fragmented, lacking a systematic concept, so I started reading books and recording each author’s experiences. If I encounter similar situations, having this “knowledge confidence” will prevent me from being flustered.</p><h3 id="leading-snowflakes"><span class="me-2">Leading Snowflakes</span><a href="#leading-snowflakes" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><ul><li>Language: English<li>Author: Oren Ellenbogen<li>Publication Year: 2013<li><a href="https://leadingsnowflakes.com/" target="_blank">Official Website</a><li>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tzangms" target="_blank">Hai Zongli</a> for the recommendation</ul><p>The author, with nearly 20 years of work experience, transitioned from a software engineer to a management position step by step; having served as a Technical Lead and Engineering Manager in both large companies and startups. This book details the bottlenecks encountered when transitioning from an engineer to a management position and the methods to organize and solve them.</p><p>I find my background very similar, having originally worked in software development and now exploring management.

Our mission is to enhance team capabilities, explore new technologies, and improve the company’s technical vision both internally and externally. Tasks can include pre-researching technical issues and sharing them with teammates for execution, resolving the company’s technical debt, improving processes to increase development efficiency, using new technologies, open-sourcing company technology, opening APIs, participating in external hackathons, etc.</p><h4 id="the-most-important-thing-is-still-balance"><span class="me-2">The most important thing is still balance</span><a href="#the-most-important-thing-is-still-balance" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The author suggests starting with a 15-20% ratio. Originally, it was 100% as Maker, but now it might be 20% as Maker / 80% as Manager (though this depends on the actual team size and member capabilities; the author also mentions that 50% / 50% is possible). The key is not to be 100% invested in engineering development but to spend more effort on management.</p><h4 id="make-good-use-of-11"><span class="me-2">Make good use of 1:1</span><a href="#make-good-use-of-11" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Regularly have 1:1 meetings with teammates to provide mutual feedback and share what you’ve learned.</p><h4 id="if-management-tasks-consume-all-your-time"><span class="me-2">If management tasks consume all your time</span><a href="#if-management-tasks-consume-all-your-time" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The author finally mentions that if your management tasks are so overwhelming that you can’t do any engineering (as Maker) work and become disconnected from tasks and technology, you might consider working from home (WFH) a few days a week to isolate yourself from the company or participate in hackathons.</p><h3 id="lesson-2--code-review-your-management-decisions"><span class="me-2">Lesson 2. — Code Review Your Management Decisions</span><a href="#lesson-2--code-review-your-management-decisions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Regularly review the decisions you make as a manager.</p><p>As engineers, we have many methods or tools that, if followed, can improve our abilities, such as pair programming, code review, and design patterns. But as managers, especially new ones, we often feel quite lonely.</p><p>We don’t want to admit our ignorance to our superiors or subordinates, fear being responsible for the team’s success, and worry about balancing technical debt and business needs.</p><p>The author mentions stepping out to seek ways to improve management skills, openly soliciting feedback, and enhancing management skills; being a manager can be as passionate as being an engineer.</p><h4 id="record--review-decisions"><span class="me-2">Record &amp; Review Decisions</span><a href="#record--review-decisions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Colleagues and bosses are powerful resources we often underestimate.

If it weren’t a dilemma, you probably wouldn’t ask. If you ask, it means teammates don’t know how to decide.</p><p>We can list options and provide decisions to teammates, but at the same time, we should also note the decisions made.</p><p><a href="/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*ckCF-uBpxAjNzbUTdvMhBA.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/1c9eafd4a190/1*ckCF-uBpxAjNzbUTdvMhBA.png" alt="Sample record sheet provided by the author" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Sample record sheet provided by the author</p><p>Develop the habit of recording and ensure the content is memorable for later.</p><p>The author suggests reviewing monthly, sharing and discussing decisions with your boss, other managers, or colleagues (at least half of the issues), and listening to others’ opinions.

He feared damaging the original relationship, so he took on all the finishing tasks himself. But eventually, he found that the more he protected, the more distant he became from teammates because he kept working hard alone, sharing less, and causing teammates to lose faith.</p><p>Looking back, the author says it’s better to express your true thoughts rather than fear hurting teammates’ feelings. “Fear of hurting teammates” is simply a selfish imagination, unnecessary. Moreover, it’s the manager’s responsibility to lead the team to grow and move forward, to see the big picture, and control risks.</p><p>Sharing true thoughts is difficult for both sides, but it’s the manager’s responsibility.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kgKanOYSsU" target="_blank" class="img-link shimmer" ><img data-src="/assets/1c9eafd4a190/b618_hqdefault.jpg" alt="Empathy vs Sympathy" title="Empathy vs Sympathy" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>We need to show empathy, not sympathy. To make their work truly outstanding, they need our objective opinions.</p><p><strong>The author provides the following three points to help balance emotions and behavior:</strong></p><ol><li>Am I showing empathy?<li>Have I clearly stated my expectations?<li>Am I leading by example?</ol><blockquote><p>“If you want to achieve anything in this world, you have to get used to the idea that not everyone will like you.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you want to achieve something, you must get used to the fact that not everyone will like your ideas.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Four common pitfalls:</strong></p><ol><li>Do I openly share my failures instead of covering them up? (This can be done by writing articles or sending emails to everyone)<li>Forgetting to summarize discussion results (Get used to recording 1:1 and discussion outcomes)<li>Using the wrong feedback medium and not getting to the real issue (Find the appropriate feedback channel according to team culture, e.g., 1:1)<li>Not providing timely feedback We need to be aware that engineers like to challenge themselves, improve their skills, and also want respect and feedback from their supervisors. Our mission is to lead the team to grow, so we should not delay any opportunity for feedback. Not making a decision is also a decision, and once the culture of feedback weakens, it becomes harder to reignite.</ol><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Spend time writing down ways to motivate teammates and ask supervisors if they are being too protective of the team.</p><h3 id="lesson-4--teach-how-to-get-things-done"><span class="me-2">Lesson 4. — Teach how to get things done</span><a href="#lesson-4--teach-how-to-get-things-done" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>How to complete tasks with lower risk.</p><p>Leading by example is a good method.

Without a backup plan, it is better not to implement it, as it can affect team confidence.<li>Break tasks into smaller tasks to reduce deadline risk It may be difficult at first, but it can be trained and learned.<li>Utilize peer pressure Break tasks down for teammates to collaborate on, working together (Code Review is also part of this).<li>Continuously communicate internally and externally Internally: Ensure expectations, synchronization, deadlines, and resources. Externally: Communicate, and if time is tight, push back on unimportant meetings.<li>Support, fix bugs, and document It’s not just about releasing features; you also need to provide customer support, fix bugs, and document.<li>Conduct reviews and delegate tasks, providing leadership opportunities for others.<li>Select a few tasks to lead by example.<li>Ask teammates what they have learned, what motivates them to be more proactive, and what they dislike.</ol><h3 id="lesson-5--delegate-tasks-without-losing-quality-or-visibility"><span class="me-2">Lesson 5. — Delegate tasks without losing quality or visibility</span><a href="#lesson-5--delegate-tasks-without-losing-quality-or-visibility" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Delegate tasks while maintaining quality and visibility.</p><p>As a manager, you must delegate tasks properly. The author believes that delegation should involve setting expectations and trusting that the assigned teammates have the ability to execute, learn, and have room for mistakes.

Defining the direction of each team is not difficult (e.g., iOS team works on the iOS app), but aligning all teams’ goals is challenging.</p><p>The more teams there are, the harder it is to unify everyone’s values, expectations, priorities, and implicit expectations.</p><p>We should focus on the reasons and motivations for splitting teams rather than the output, as this can lead to contradictions.</p><p><strong>The author believes the following methods can align the direction of each team:</strong></p><ol><li>Teams should have a vision, not just handle tasks.<li>Managers need to distinguish between needs and wants.<li>Optimize the team to complete the right things faster, not just more things.<li>Establish good communication with other team managers. The author suggests sharing the team’s status, obstacles, pains, and upcoming major tasks and reasons in bi-weekly manager meetings.<li>When there are differing opinions on priorities with other teams, explain and bring up other factors (e.g., this will reduce CS complaints, be a one-time fix, have a multiplier effect, etc.).<li>First, understand where external teams need our help and actively follow up.<li>Then, bring up where our team needs help from external teams.<li>List the items that need confirmation to ensure they are discussed in the meeting. If not, follow up with relevant managers afterward to see if there are other possibilities.<li>If not possible, weigh the potential delays or alternative solutions and inform stakeholders (to prevent backbiting).<li>Everything is a trade-off.</ol><p><strong>Additionally, here are 5 ways to help teammates build close relationships with other teams:</strong></p><ul><li>Simple thank-you notes (expressing gratitude for assistance)<li>Team work exchange<li>Internal tech conferences to share knowledge<li>Observing user behavior together and brainstorming optimization ideas<li>Inviting a teammate from another team to join our work</ul><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Imagine that someone from Team A drops a feature that Team B needs, due to an urgent support issue.
