features<li>Exploring-Squad: Focuses on browsing and exploration<li>Ad-Squad: Focuses on platform advertising<li>Out-Of-Squad: Primarily supports, infra, or process optimization</ul><p>Each Squad is composed of various function teammates, including PM, Product Designer, Data, Frontend, Backend, iOS, Android, etc.; long-term and ongoing work goals are accomplished by the Squad.</p><p>In addition to Squads, there are also cross-team Projects that run, mostly short to medium-term work goals, where the initiator or any team member can act as the Project Owner, and the task is closed upon completion.</p><blockquote><p><em>At the end, there is also <strong>how Pinkoi’s culture supports teammates in solving problems</strong>, if <strong>friends who are not interested in the actual content can directly scroll to the bottom of the page to view this section</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><h3 id="relationship-between-team-size-and-efficiency"><span class="me-2">Relationship Between Team Size and Efficiency</span><a href="#relationship-between-team-size-and-efficiency" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*V7jEnBoR5XpRsPM-WF8GdA.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*V7jEnBoR5XpRsPM-WF8GdA.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>The relationship between team size growth and work efficiency, from startups with 10 people to teams of hundreds (not yet challenged by thousands), but just jumping from 10 to 100, the 10x difference is significant in many aspects.</p><p>With fewer people, communication and handling things are quick; discussing and resolving issues in person can be done swiftly, as the “human connection” is strong, enabling synchronous collaboration.</p><p>However, in situations with more people, direct communication becomes challenging because with more collaborators, each discussion can take up a whole morning; and with many people collaborating, tasks need to be prioritized, and non-urgent matters cannot be addressed immediately, requiring asynchronous waiting to work on other tasks.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*nkSy-H-33Jdtf10fISwqrw.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*nkSy-H-33Jdtf10fISwqrw.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Having more diverse roles join can lead to more specialized work division, increased productivity or quality, and faster output.</p><p>But as mentioned earlier, conversely; there will be more collaboration with people, which means more time spent on communication.</p><p>Moreover, small issues can be magnified, for example, if one person used to spend 10 minutes daily on a task like posting reports, it was manageable; but now, assuming there are 20 people, it multiplies, and each day, more than 3 hours are spent on posting reports; optimizing and automating this task becomes valuable at this point, saving 3 hours daily, which amounts to wasting an extra 750 hours over a year.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*S-OXkos4LdViqlTtgP-DXg.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*S-OXkos4LdViqlTtgP-DXg.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>As the team size grows, for the App Team, there are these roles that collaborate more closely.</p><p>Backend — API, Product Designer — UI, these do not need to be mentioned, Pinkoi is an international product, so all functional texts need to be translated by the Localization Team. Also, because we have a Data Team doing data collection and analysis, besides developing features, we also need to discuss event tracking points with the Data Team.</p><p>Customer Service is also a team that frequently interacts with us. Besides users sometimes directly providing feedback on order issues through the marketplace, more often users leave a one-star rating saying they encountered a problem. At this time, we also need the customer service team to help with in-depth inquiries, such as what problem did you encounter? How can we help you?</p><p>With so many collaborative relationships mentioned above, it means there are many communication opportunities.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>However, remember, we are not avoiding or minimizing communication as much as possible; excellent engineers also need good communication skills.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>What we need to focus on is important communication, such as brainstorming, discussing requirements, content, and schedules; do not waste time on confirming repetitive issues or vague communication. Avoid situations where you ask me, I ask him, and so on.</p><p>Especially in the era of the pandemic, communication time is precious and should be spent on more valuable discussions.</p><p>“I thought you thought what I thought” — this sentence perfectly illustrates the consequences of unclear communication.</p><p>Not just in work, in daily life, we often encounter misunderstandings due to different perceptions, and in life, harmony relies on mutual understanding; but in work, it’s different. If different perceptions are not discussed in depth, it’s easy to find out during the production stage that things are not as expected.</p><h3 id="interface-communication"><span class="me-2">Interface Communication</span><a href="#interface-communication" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The idea introduced here is to communicate through a consensus interface, similar to the Dependency Inversion Principle in object-oriented programming in SOLID principles (if you don’t understand, it’s okay); the same concept can be applied to communication.</p><p>The first step is to identify areas of communication that are unclear, need to be confirmed repeatedly, or require specific communication to be more focused and effective, or even situations where this delivery does not require additional communication.</p><p>Once the issues are identified, you can define an “interface.” An interface is a medium, which can be a document, process, checklist, tool, etc.</p><p>Use this “interface” as a bridge for communication between each other. There can be multiple interfaces, use the appropriate interface for each scenario; when encountering the same scenario, prioritize using this interface for initial communication. If further communication is needed, it can be based on this interface for focused discussion of the issues.</p><h4 id="app-teams-collaboration-with-external-parties"><span class="me-2">App Team’s Collaboration with External Parties</span><a href="#app-teams-collaboration-with-external-parties" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Here are 4 examples of interface communication in collaboration with the App Team:</p><ol><li>The first one is the situation with Backend collaboration before any interface consensus, as shown in the above image.</ol><p>For how to use the API, if simply providing the API Response String to the App Team, there can be areas of ambiguity, for example, how do we know if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> refers to Register Date or Birthday? Also, the scope is broad, many fields need confirmation.</p><p>This communication is also repetitive, requiring confirmation each time there is a new endpoint.</p><p>This is a classic case of ineffective communication.</p><ol><li>App and Backend lack a communication interface between them. There are many solutions, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be a tool; it can be a manually maintained document.</ol><p>Pinkoi uses Python (FastAPI) to automatically generate documentation from the API code, PHP can use Swagger (previous company practice); the advantage is that the framework and data format of the document can be automatically generated from the code, reducing maintenance costs, only needing to handle field descriptions.</p><p>p.s. Currently, new Python 3 will use FastAPI, and the old parts will be gradually updated. For now, PostMan is used as the communication interface.</p><p>The second one is collaborating with the Product Designer, which is similar to the Backend in principle, but the focus shifts to confirming UI Spec and Flow.</p><p>If the color codes and fonts are scattered, our App will also suffer. Setting aside the fact that requirements are like this, we don’t want situations where the same title has the same color but the color code is off or the UI at the same position is not consistent.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*smel97dJH6y2LzXdWTKYYw.jpeg" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*smel97dJH6y2LzXdWTKYYw.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>The most basic solution is to have the designer organize the UI components library, establish a Design System (Guideline), and mark them when designing UI.</p><p>Based on the Design System (Guideline) in the Code Base, we create corresponding Font, Color, and Button, View based on the component library.</p><p>When templating, use these established components for templating, making it easy for us to quickly align with the UI design draft.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>But this is easily messed up and needs dynamic adjustments; it cannot cover too many exceptions, nor can it be rigid and not expand.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>p.s. Collaboration with Product Designers at Pinkoi is mutual, where Developers can also suggest better practices and discuss with Product Designers.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*jWzR6iVOeXD9naa3KQllLw.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*jWzR6iVOeXD9naa3KQllLw.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>The third one is the interface with Customer Service. Product reviews are crucial for products in the marketplace, but it involves a very manual and repetitive communication process.</p><p>Because we need to manually check for new reviews from time to time, and if there are customer service issues, we need to forward the issues to customer service for assistance, which is repetitive and manual.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*2e_pEWb1khuMTgJPkpCY9w.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*2e_pEWb1khuMTgJPkpCY9w.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>The best solution is to automatically synchronize marketplace reviews to our work platform. You can spend $ to buy existing services or use my developed <a href="https://github.com/ZhgChgLi" target="_blank">ZhgChgLi</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZReviewTender" target="_blank">ZReviewTender</a> (2022 New).</p><blockquote><p><em>For deployment methods, tutorials, and technical details, refer to:</em> <a href="../e36e48bb9265/"><strong>ZReviewTender - Free and Open-source App Reviews Monitoring Bot</strong></a></p></blockquote><p>This bot is our communication interface. It will automatically forward reviews to a Slack Channel, allowing everyone to quickly receive the latest review information, track, and communicate on it.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*9SG2JlwEfNSJq9WxscfV5w.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*9SG2JlwEfNSJq9WxscfV5w.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>The last example is the dependency on the Localization Team’s work; whether it’s a new feature or modifying old translations, we need to wait for the Localization Team to complete the work and hand it over to us for further assistance.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*vJcYjkcLpZcKRvgFzP5C1g.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*vJcYjkcLpZcKRvgFzP5C1g.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>The cost of developing our own tools is too high, so we directly use third-party services to help us break the dependency.</p><p>All translations and keys are managed by third-party tools. We just need to define the keys in advance, and both sides can work separately. As long as the work is completed before the deadline, there is no need for mutual reliance. After the Localization Team completes the translation, the tool will automatically trigger a git pull to update the latest text files in the project.</p><p>p.s. Pinkoi has had this process since very early on, using Onesky at that time, but in recent years, there are more excellent tools available, which you can consider adopting.</p><h4 id="collaboration-within-the-app-team"><span class="me-2">Collaboration within the App Team</span><a href="#collaboration-within-the-app-team" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>We talked about external factors, now let’s talk about internal factors.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*Jg0DrQsNe1QA6UOT3Z_elg.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*Jg0DrQsNe1QA6UOT3Z_elg.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>When there are fewer people or when one developer maintains a project, you can do whatever you want. You have a high level of mastery and understanding of the project, which is fine. Of course, if you have a good sense, even if it’s a one-person project, you can handle all the things mentioned here.</p><p>But as the number of collaborating teammates increases, everyone is working under the same project. If everyone still works separately, it will be a disaster.</p><p>For example, doing API calls differently here and there, often reinventing the wheel wasting time, or not caring at all and just putting something online haphazardly, all will incur significant costs for future maintenance and scalability.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*5wBfMU9AiCVfmEcvmPZSiQ.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*5wBfMU9AiCVfmEcvmPZSiQ.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Within the team, rather than calling it an interface, I think it’s too formal; it should be about consensus, resonance, and a sense of teamwork.</p><p>The most basic and common topic is Coding Style, naming conventions, where to place things, how to use Delegates… You can use commonly used tools like <a href="https://github.com/realm" target="_blank">realm</a> / <a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint" target="_blank">SwiftLint</a> for constraints, and for multilingual sentences, you can use <a href="https://github.com/freshOS" target="_blank">freshOS</a> / <a href="https://github.com/freshOS/Localize" target="_blank">Localize</a> for organization (of course, if you are already using a third-party tool for management as mentioned earlier, you may not need this).</p><p>The second is the App architecture, whether it’s MVC/MVVM/VIPER/Clean Architecture, the key point is cleanliness and consistency; no need to pursue being trendy, just be consistent.</p><blockquote><p><em>The Pinkoi App Team uses <a href="https://www.yourator.co/articles/171#Matt" target="_blank">Clean Architecture</a>.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Previously at StreetVoice, it was purely MVC but clean and consistent, making collaboration smooth.</em></p></blockquote><p>Next is UnitTest, with many people, it’s hard to avoid the logic you’re working on from accidentally being broken; writing more tests provides an extra layer of protection.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the aspect of documentation, about the team’s work processes, specifications, or operation manuals, making it easy for teammates to quickly refer to when they forget, and for new members to quickly get up to speed.</p><p>Besides the Code Level interface, there are other interfaces in collaboration to help us improve efficiency.</p><p>The first is having a Request for Comments stage before implementing requirements, where the developer in charge roughly explains how this requirement will be implemented, and others can provide comments and ideas.</p><p>In addition to preventing reinventing the wheel, it can also gather more ideas, such as how others might expand in the future, or what requirements to consider later on… etc., as onlookers see more clearly than those involved.</p><p>The second is to conduct thorough Code Reviews, checking if our interface consensus is being implemented, such as: Naming conventions, UI layout methods, Delegate usage, Protocol/Class declarations… etc. Also, checking if the architecture is being misused or rushed due to time constraints, assuming the development direction should move towards full Swift development, and whether there are still Objective-C code being used… etc.</p><p>The main focus is on reviewing these aspects, with functionality correctness being secondary assistance.</p><p>p.s. The purpose of RFC is to improve work efficiency, so it shouldn’t be too lengthy or seriously delay work progress; it can be thought of as a simple pre-work discussion phase.</p><p>Consolidating the team’s internal interface consensus functions, finally mentioning the <strong>Crash Theory</strong> mindset, which I think is a good behavioral benchmark.</p><p>Applying it to the team means assuming that if everyone suddenly disappeared today, can the existing code, processes, and systems allow new people to quickly get up to speed?</p><p>Recap the meaning of interfaces, internal team interfaces are used to increase mutual consensus, external collaboration is to reduce ineffective communication, using interfaces as a means of communication without interruption, focusing on discussing requirements.</p><p>Reiterating that “interface communication” is not a special term or tool in engineering, it’s just a concept applicable to collaboration in any job scenario, it can simply be a document or process, with the sequence being to have this thing first and then communicate.</p><p>Assuming each additional communication time takes 10 minutes, with a team of 60 people, occurring 10 times per month, it wastes 1,200 hours per year on unnecessary communication.</p><h3 id="improving-efficiency---automating-repetitive-work"><span class="me-2">Improving Efficiency - Automating Repetitive Work</span><a href="#improving-efficiency---automating-repetitive-work" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The second chapter wants to share with everyone about the effects of automating repetitive work on improving work efficiency, using iOS as an example, but the same applies to Android.</p><p>It won’t mention technical implementation details, only discussing the feasibility in principle.</p><p>Organizing the services we use, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Slack: Communication software<li>Fastlane: iOS automation script tool<li>Github: Git Provider<li>Github Action: Github’s CI/CD service, will be introduced later<li>Firebase: Crashlytics, Event, App Distribution (to be introduced later), Remote Config…<li>Google Apps Script: Google Apps plugin script program, to be introduced later<li>Bitrise: CI/CD Server<li>Onesky: As mentioned earlier, a third-party tool for Localization<li>Testflight: iOS App internal testing platform<li>Google Calendar: Google Calendar, to be introduced for what purpose<li>Asana: Project management tool</ul><h4 id="issues-with-releasing-beta-versions"><span class="me-2">Issues with Releasing Beta Versions</span><a href="#issues-with-releasing-beta-versions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*kaNm3auxnqlJ4ObE84sitA.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*kaNm3auxnqlJ4ObE84sitA.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>The first issue to address is the problem of repetitiveness. During the development phase, when we want to allow other team members to test the app in advance, the traditional approach is to directly build it on their phones. If there are only 1-2 people, it’s not a big problem. However, if there are 20-30 team members to test, just helping with installing the beta version would take up a whole day of work. Additionally, if there are updates, everything has to start over.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*r_jYD3jukkUPKOdtnK8zyA.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*r_jYD3jukkUPKOdtnK8zyA.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Another method is to use TestFlight as a medium for distributing beta versions, which is also good. However, there are two issues. First, TestFlight is equivalent to the production environment, not the debug environment. Second, when there are many teammates working on different requirements simultaneously and needing to test different requirements, TestFlight can become chaotic, and the builds for distribution may change frequently, but it’s still manageable.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*XLB0THtHAM65_e4FdtEXKg.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*XLB0THtHAM65_e4FdtEXKg.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Pinkoi’s solution is to separate the task of “installing beta versions by the App Team” and use Slack Workflow as an input UI to achieve this. After inputting the necessary information, it triggers Bitrise to run Fastlane scripts to package and upload the beta version IPA to Firebase App Distribution.</p><blockquote><p><em>For more information on using Slack Workflow applications, refer to this article: <a href="../d61062833c1a/">Building a Fully Automated WFH Employee Health Status Reporting System with Slack</a></em></p></blockquote><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*2mNIlReKlROzcgviY9_JTg.jpeg" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*2mNIlReKlROzcgviY9_JTg.jpeg" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*dwwOvnVwuF1sCUnyppBCDQ.jpeg" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*dwwOvnVwuF1sCUnyppBCDQ.jpeg" alt="Firebase App Distribution" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Firebase App Distribution</p><p>Teammates who need to test simply follow the steps provided by Firebase App Distribution to install the necessary certificates, register their devices, and then choose the beta version they want to install or directly install it by clicking the link.</p><blockquote><p><em>However, please note that iOS Firebase App Distribution is limited to Development Devices, with a maximum registration of 100 devices, based on devices rather than individuals.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Therefore, you may need to consider a balance between this solution and TestFlight (which allows external testing by up to 1,000 people).</em></p></blockquote><p>At least, the Slack Workflow UI Input mentioned earlier is worth considering.</p><blockquote><p><em>For advanced features, consider developing a Slack Bot for a more complete and customizable workflow and form usage.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*-2oet_gRdews7-wccdrmiA.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*-2oet_gRdews7-wccdrmiA.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Recap the effectiveness of automating the release of beta versions, the most significant benefit is moving the entire process to the cloud for execution, allowing the App Team to be hands-off and fully self-service.</p><h4 id="issues-with-packaging-official-releases"><span class="me-2">Issues with Packaging Official Releases</span><a href="#issues-with-packaging-official-releases" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The second common task for the App Team is packaging and submitting the official version of the app for review.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*Fd245lp2QSQV7d3AIdf94w.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*Fd245lp2QSQV7d3AIdf94w.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>When the team is small and follows a single-line development approach, managing app version updates is not a big issue and can be done freely and regularly.</p><p>However, in larger teams with multiple concurrent development and iteration needs, the situation depicted above may arise. Without proper “interface communication” as mentioned earlier, everyone may work independently, leading to the App Team being overwhelmed. The cost of app updates is higher than web updates, the process is more complex, and frequent and disorderly updates can disrupt users.</p><p>The final issue is management. Without a fixed process or timeline, it’s challenging to optimize each step.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*eRm97daYTwlEBFGtWoZgdQ.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*eRm97daYTwlEBFGtWoZgdQ.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>The solution is to introduce a Release Train into the development process, with the core concept of separating version updates from project development.</p><p>We establish a fixed schedule and define what will be done at each stage:</p><ul><li>New version update every Monday morning<li>Code Freeze on Wednesday (no more merging of feature PRs)<li>QA starts on Thursday<li>Official packaging on Friday</ul><p>The actual timeline for QA and the release cycle (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) can be adjusted according to each company’s situation. <strong>The key is to determine what needs to be done at specific times.</strong></p><p>This is a survey on version release cycles conducted by foreign peers, with most opting for a bi-weekly release.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*uOXXmdDoocyFImsq-z7tVQ.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*uOXXmdDoocyFImsq-z7tVQ.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>When it comes to weekly updates and our multiple teams, it will be as shown in the image above.</p><p>The Release Train, as the name suggests, is like a train station, and each version is a train.</p><p><strong>If you miss it, you have to wait for the next one.</strong> Each Squad team and project choose their own time to board.</p><p>This is a great communication interface, as long as there is consensus and adherence to the rules, version updates can proceed smoothly.</p><p><strong>For more technical details on Release Train, please refer to:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/lgvalle/mobile-release-trains" target="_blank">Mobile release trains — Travelperk</a><li><a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/" target="_blank">Agile Release Train</a><li><a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/quality-mobile-trains" target="_blank">Release Quality and Mobile Trains</a></ul><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*DZwSmwnVCGkO--1PEzgqgw.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*DZwSmwnVCGkO--1PEzgqgw.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Once the process and schedule are determined, we can optimize what we do at each stage.</p><p>For example, packaging the official version manually is time-consuming.

During this time, work status needs to be constantly switched, making it difficult to do other tasks; this process is repeated for each packaging, wasting work efficiency.</p><p><a href="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*RPSgRUXh3ITDJykQ6N-DTw.png" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="/assets/11f6c8568154/1*RPSgRUXh3ITDJykQ6N-DTw.png" alt="" class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p>Now that we have a fixed schedule, we directly integrate Google Calendar here. We add the tasks to be done at the expected schedule to the calendar. When the time comes, Google Apps Script will call Bitrise to execute the Fastlane script for packaging the official version and submission, completing all the work.</p><p>Using Google Calendar integration has another benefit. If there are unexpected situations that require postponement or advancement, you can directly go in and change the date.</p><blockquote><p><em>To automatically execute Google Apps Script when the Google Calendar event time arrives, currently, you have to set up the service yourself.
