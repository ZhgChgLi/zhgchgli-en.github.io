id="preface"><span class="me-2">Preface</span><a href="#preface" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>At the end of August, I officially left Pinkoi after nearly 3 years. I had been contemplating leaving for a while, and earlier in the year, I decided to take a break from work, explore outside, and reassess the situation upon my return. So, I embarked on trips with friends to “<a href="../76d66c2e34af/">[Travelogue] 2023 Kansai &amp; 🇯🇵 First Landing</a>” and with colleagues to “<a href="../9da2c51fa4f2/">[Travelogue] 2023 Tokyo &amp; 🇯🇵 Second Landing</a>.” However, upon returning, I felt a stronger urge to break free, coinciding with the completion of my tasks. I gathered my courage to step out of my comfort zone, seeking the next challenge!</p><p>The “<a href="../7b8a0563c157/">[Travelogue] Flash Visit to Nagoya on 9/11</a>” was purely accidental and felt more like a march than a relaxing trip.</p><p>Taking advantage of a rare opportunity, I decided to explore Japan once again. The original plan was to travel with a friend who was also on a break to <strong>🇰🇷 Busan ➡️ 🇯🇵 Fukuoka ➡️ 🇯🇵 Kumamoto</strong>; traveling from Korea to Kumamoto, with a stop in Fukuoka where we could board the <a href="https://journey.tw/new-camellia/" target="_blank">New Camellia</a> cruise ship, arriving in Fukuoka after a 12-hour overnight journey, covering both commuting and accommodation.</p><p>However, my friend found a job in September and I couldn’t find a new travel companion at the moment. Not keen on extensive travel alone, I decided to forgo the 🇰🇷 Busan ➡️ 🇯🇵 Fukuoka segment and instead opted for the 🇯🇵 Fukuoka ➡️ 🇯🇵 Kumamoto route.</p><p>With a scattered schedule starting in October and plans to begin job hunting, I scheduled my departure at the end of September (9/17–9/26).</p><h3 id="summary--retro"><span class="me-2">Summary / Retro</span><a href="#summary--retro" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>I’ll start with the summary and reflection. I came across a quote in a travel group that resonated with me: “Traveling is a continuous payment of tuition (time or money) for learning. The more experience you gain, the fewer pitfalls you’ll encounter.”</p><p>👍</p><ul><li>Coca-Cola, peach water, FamilyMart’s fruit juice, and Akia plum wine are delicious!<li>Japanese professional baseball is worth watching! When buying tickets, opt for whole rows or aisle seats, and choose the cheaper options.<li>The JR Pass may not always save money, but it definitely did in Kyushu! Saved at least over 1,000 TWD.<li>Solo travel led to many interesting encounters; for example, helping a Japanese family get souvenirs from Mihara City, a kind foreign sister volunteering to take photos, a Taiwanese family on a boat tour, a TSMC employee completing the Aso journey together, and helping another family take photos in Kumamoto, only to meet them again at the airport and take more photos… and so on.<li>Kumamon, the mascot of Kumamoto, can be found all over Kyushu (not just in Kumamoto).<li>Kyushu (not just Kumamoto) is spacious with few people, allowing for easy access to renowned eateries and attractions without long queues, providing a comfortable experience.<li>Made slight progress in Japanese, understanding numbers (though still double-checking with Google Translate), understanding phrases like “plastic bag needed,” “checkout,” “this,” “above,” “cash,” “credit card,” and imperative sentences for duty-free shopping (“XXX お願いします”).<li>Completed writing the travelogue!</ul><p>👎</p><ul><li>Accommodation this time was disappointing: When booking hotels in Japan, it’s essential to check reviews, especially negative ones, to assess whether you can tolerate any issues. Walk around the area on Street View to gauge the convenience.<li>Spent too many days in Kumamoto this time; 2 days would have sufficed, allowing for a visit to Oita on other days. Moreover, Fukuoka is much closer to Kumamoto than Nagasaki: In the past, I would secure accommodation before planning sightseeing, given Kyushu’s vast expanse; it’s better to decide on destinations first and then arrange accommodation to access more attractions.<li>Fukuoka offers much better accommodation options, prices, and quality compared to Kumamoto.<li>Missed the festival in Yufuin this time (I went to Nagasaki that day): In the future, I’ll check for festival dates before planning trips; everyone recommends attending festivals, so it’s a must-do.<li>The JR Pass allows for Shinkansen travel, but not on the “Nozomi” or “Mizuho” trains; additional tickets are required for these services.<li>Solo travel with a language barrier can be quite lonely, often leading to introspection and solitude.<li>Accommodation tends to be pricier for solo travelers.<li>Spent too much time rushing through attractions this time; should slow down, savor the moment, and explore local cuisine leisurely, especially missing out on renowned eateries in Japan.<li>The sun in Kyushu during this season is still scorching, so proper sun protection is necessary.<li>Northern Nagasaki is mediocre (Dutch and Chinatown), while southern Nagasaki stands out more for its night views.</ul><h3 id="kkday-promotion"><span class="me-2">KKday Promotion</span><a href="#kkday-promotion" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><ul><li><div class="table-wrapper"><table><tbody><tr><td>[Japan JR PASS<td>Kyushu Area Railway Pass<td>North Kyushu &amp;

There are many foreigners exchanging for the JR Pass, so I waited for almost an hour before my turn. It is recommended to leave early or go to exchange in advance.</p><blockquote><p>I bought a 5-day pass, which starts counting from the day of exchange. Use the pass with the date and amount for entering and exiting the station; the reserved seat ticket is just to know where your seat is and cannot be used to enter and exit the station. Keep the pass safe as you will need it for the next five days; if lost, it cannot be replaced!</p></blockquote><p>There are two segments from Hakata to Nagasaki, first to Takeo Onsen and then change trains to Nagasaki from Takeo Onsen; changing trains on the same platform, they have the train times well calculated, so basically, after arriving, just walk to the opposite side to board the train.</p><p>When waiting for the train, I found that the trains in Kyushu are very distinctive!!</p><p>The seats are large and comfortable, and you can enjoy the scenery by the window.</p><p><strong>Travel time: about 1 hour 50 minutes</strong></p><p><strong>Side note: Completed a citizen diplomacy mission ✅</strong></p><blockquote><p>When I was on the train, there was a family sitting next to me.

I walked up and passed through a kindergarten to reach the Nagasaki Ropeway (Fuchi Shrine Station). Since I didn’t plan to stay too late, I bought a round-trip ticket directly (cheaper, but if you stay too late, there might not be a cable car available, and you’ll have to take the bus back).</p><p>After getting off the cable car, there is another cable car for mountain viewing, but I didn’t try it. So, I walked straight towards the observation deck.</p><p>I forgot to take a photo of the observation deck, which is a 360-degree tower where you can see the entire Nagasaki city, harbor, and mountains without needing a ticket. You can start by watching the sunset from the west as the sun sets over the harbor and continue to enjoy the night view of the city from the east.</p><p>The observation deck is spacious and can accommodate many people.</p><p>After sunset, you can enjoy the beautiful night view of the entire Nagasaki city and the station.</p><p>Finally, take a last look at the night view of Nagasaki Station, buy a Nagasaki cake souvenir (later found out they are also sold in Hakata, with a shelf life of about 12 days, so it’s better to buy them later…), and get ready to return to Hakata.</p><blockquote><div class="table-wrapper"><table><tbody><tr><td>_If you don’t want to visit all these places on your own, you can refer to KKday’s [**Nagasaki Day Tour<td>Glover Garden · Oura Cathedral &amp;

the hotel, in the past, I actually wouldn’t pay much attention to reviews; as long as it’s around 3 stars or above, it’s fine; the soundproofing of this one is not good, and I encountered a whole

which I can tolerate (I brought earplugs myself); but as mentioned in previous reviews, the hotel’s WiFi is just a sham.</p><p>The WiFi signal is available throughout the hotel, but even with a full signal in the room, the speed is still very slow, websites won’t load, you have to stand by the door to get a normal internet speed, it’s almost like the hotel has no internet.</p><blockquote><p>The price is not attractive either, it’s better to stay in Fukuoka, for the same price, you can stay at APA in Fukuoka.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After this experience, I now know that even for Japanese hotels, it’s important to check the reviews…</p></blockquote><p>Apart from the convenience of being close to the airport, there are no other advantages, and there are no convenience stores nearby (you have to walk for more than 10 minutes to find one).</p><h3 id="day-6-suizenji-jojuen-garden-kumamon-square-performance-hanabata-plaza-sakura-machi-shopping-center"><span class="me-2">Day 6

performance, you can go in, if you’re late, you may have to watch the monitor outside, if you have children, you can sit inside.</p><p>Before the performance, the order rules will be explained, for example: you cannot pat Kumamon, do not hold the camera too high (it will block the view behind), according to Japanese law, if there are faces, they must be pixelated, and everyone is welcome to upload to SNS.</p><p>The performance lasts about 30 minutes. The hostess will help Kumamon speak (all in Japanese). The process is roughly to greet everyone, talk about interesting things in Kumamoto, dance (the above song is very catchy), and say hi to people from different countries (Taiwanese people are the majority here).</p><p>Kumamon is very cute and has big, interesting movements.</p><p>There are fewer peripheral products sold in the square, and the prices are relatively high, so I didn’t buy anything here.</p><p>After watching the performance until close to noon, walk down the shopping street to eat at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LFjoSMqAAKokpQ7x7">Shouritei Shinshigai Honten</a>; walking outside the shopping street, suddenly upgraded from a children’s level to a restricted level, with rows of free guides (the other side is Kumamoto Ginza Street as well).</p><p>The super thick Jucie pork cutlet rice is special because it comes with their pickled vegetables (shared, self-serve, remember to use the red chopsticks). Other than that, it’s similar to eating Japanese pork cutlet in Taiwan. They will give you a grinding stick and sesame seeds to make the sauce; rice, tea, soup, and cabbage are all free for refills; I ate two bowls of rice in one go and felt very satisfied.</p><h4 id="hanabatake-square"><span class="me-2">Hanabatake Square</span><a href="#hanabatake-square" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>After eating and drinking, continue walking down the shopping street towards Hanabatake Square.</p><p>There happened to be an event at the square on Saturday, Food Summit 2003, with food stalls all around, and a stage in the middle for performances.</p><p>I bought a glass of sparkling wine and a grilled sausage to sit down and watch the performance.
